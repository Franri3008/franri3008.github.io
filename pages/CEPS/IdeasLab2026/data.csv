1,"The most significant challenge for climate action today is the absence of shared responsibility across countries, sectors and institutions. Historical emissions and unequal contributions to the crisis are real and must be acknowledged, yet the global conversation has become dominated by cycles of accusation rather than collective commitment. From the perspective of the Global South, including countries like India, there is a justified call for accountability from industrialised nations. However, this cannot become a substitute for proactive action at home. Many developing countries continue to treat climate action as secondary to development, rather than recognising that resilient growth now depends on a low-carbon, resource-efficient pathway. This gap between what is needed and what is politically prioritised creates delays that the world can no longer afford. In essence, climate action is constrained not by a lack of technical solutions, but by a lack of coordinated political will and policy action. Until countries move beyond defensive postures and embrace differentiated yet complementary responsibilities, global progress will remain uneven and insufficient.",0.87377286,0.31458026,0.6527611,0.775462631481344,#f3a134
2,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the disconnect between global policy commitments and local implementation, particularly in vulnerable communities in the Global South. While international frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, set ambitious targets, translating these goals into tangible action at the local level remains difficult. Limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and socio-economic vulnerabilities often hinder communities from adopting sustainable practices, even when policies exist.

Another significant challenge is climate inequity. Those who have contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions�often low-income and marginalized communities�are disproportionately affected by climate change impacts such as floods, heatwaves, and resource scarcity. 

Additionally, public awareness and engagement gaps impede effective climate action. Despite scientific consensus, misinformation, and lack of education on climate impacts often prevent communities and policymakers from making informed decisions.
Finally, the challenge of integrating climate action with socio-economic development remains crucial. Policies must align environmental sustainability with livelihoods, education, and health to ensure long-term resilience. Overcoming these interconnected challenges requires collaboration across governments, civil society, and the private sector, alongside innovative approaches that connect global commitments with local realities.",0.5514605,0.44913322,0.5119754,0.8156966238358455,#f3a134

This inequality limits the effectiveness of climate strategies. Another challenge is the slow transition from promises to practical, community-driven action.

I think the biggest challenge for climate action today is balancing immediate action with long-term sustainability goals, especially in vulnerable regions like Lesotho. Limited resources, lack of technology access, and the need for community-driven solutions make it tough to implement effective climate strategies. There's also a gap in awareness and education about climate impacts at the local level. Bridging these gaps through collaboration, innovation, and inclusive approaches is key to driving meaningful climate action that benefits both people and the planet.

Another key challenge is climate inequality. Those who contribute the least to the crisis youth, low-income communities, Indigenous peoples, and countries in the Global South�are the ones most affected, yet they have the least resources to adapt. Climate finance remains insufficient, unpredictable  and difficult to access, making it hard for vulnerable communities to build resilience and take part in the green transition. Additionally, climate action is hindered by misinformation, lack of public awareness and the perception that the crisis is distant or technical. This reduces public pressure on leaders and makes it difficult to build collective momentum. Finally, the crisis is moving faster than our institutions.

2428,"The biggest challenge for climate action in the Philippines today is bridging the gap between awareness and meaningful, large-scale action. While many Filipinos understand the impacts of climate change�typhoons, floods, droughts, and sea-level rise�translating this awareness into effective policies, community programs, and resilient systems remains difficult. Economic priorities, political constraints, and unequal access to resources often leave the most vulnerable�particularly coastal communities, farmers, and urban poor�at the greatest risk.

Another key challenge is ensuring inclusive solutions. Climate action cannot succeed without engaging local communities, youth, and marginalized groups, whose voices are often underrepresented in planning and decision-making. Effective interventions must combine local knowledge with science and innovation, ensuring they are culturally relevant, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable.

The pace of policy and innovation also lags behind the urgency of climate impacts.

2450,"One of the greatest challenges in climate action today is closing the gap between awareness and sustained, scalable participation. Although the urgency of climate change is increasingly understood, very few people translate that awareness into consistent, measurable action. 
This became even more evident when I founded ElanVerde. I realised that many individuals and organisations genuinely want to adopt sustainable practices, but they often do not know where to start or how to maintain their efforts once the initial motivation fades. Climate action becomes truly effective only when it is practical, community-led, and supported by transparent systems�areas where the world continues to fall short.

ElanVerde was built on the idea of simplifying sustainability. The aim was to convert interest into action and action into habit through accessible eco-initiatives, awareness efforts, and community engagement. Through this journey, I learned that the climate movement does not lack passion; it lacks structure, accountability, and clear pathways that make participation easy and long term.

Ultimately, the challenge is not only fighting climate change but turning climate action into a natural, everyday behaviour rather than an optional choice. My work with ElanVerde is centred on bridging this gap�empowering people, simplifying sustainable practices, and proving that collective action becomes achievable when supported with clarity and guidance.",0.27961922,0.3692019,0.42910206,0.6275686572284133,#f7e379
4,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the growing incredulity around climate change, not only denial, but also the erosion of public trust in institutions, scientific evidence, and policy solutions. This skepticism weakens political will, fragments collective action, and makes it harder for governments to implement transformative climate policies.

Even when technical solutions exist, carbon pricing, environmental taxes, subsidy reforms, or climate-resilient public investment, their success depends on public legitimacy. If citizens doubt the reality of climate change or distrust the institutions proposing these reforms, climate policies risk being rejected, reversed, or politically weaponized. This distrust is often amplified by misinformation, polarized public debates, and the perception that climate policies impose costs on households without delivering visible benefits.

In my work on public finance and territorial governance, I have seen how tax reforms linked to climate goals struggle when communities feel excluded or unconvinced. People are more willing to support green fiscal measures when they believe the system is fair, transparent, and capable of delivering concrete improvements to their lives.",0.3614633,0.34420818,0.5743474,0.6974661472050266,#f7e379
5,"I believe that one of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the lack of understanding and awareness about the climate crisis and its far-reaching impacts. Many people still don't grasp the severity of the issue, its causes, and its consequences, which hinders individual and collective action. This knowledge gap leads to apathy, inaction, and even skepticism, allowing climate change to continue unchecked.

Another significant challenge is the inadequate integration of climate action into national and local development plans, policies, and practices. Despite the growing urgency of the climate crisis, many governments, businesses, and institutions prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term sustainability and climate resilience. This results in insufficient climate financing, inadequate climate governance, and a lack of climate-resilient infrastructure, ultimately exacerbating the climate crisis.

Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort to raise awareness, build climate literacy, and mainstream climate action into development planning and decision-making processes. It demands a shift in mindset, policy, and practice to prioritize climate resilience, sustainability, and the well-being of people and the planet.",0.47946262,0.28732353,0.32796407,0.781232332563078,#f3a134
6,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation, driven by social, economic, and political factors. While knowledge about climate change is widespread, translating it into effective policies and meaningful local action remains limited. Many communities, especially in developing countries, face resource constraints, limited technical capacity, and inadequate infrastructure, making adaptation and mitigation measures difficult to implement.

Another major obstacle is policy fragmentation and lack of coordination. Climate solutions require cross-sectoral cooperation, yet many governments struggle to align policies across energy, agriculture, and environmental sectors. This is compounded by short-term economic priorities that often overshadow long-term sustainability goals.

At the grassroots level, community engagement and inclusivity remain critical challenges. Vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, and coastal communities, are often underrepresented in decision-making processes despite being disproportionately affected by climate risks.

From my studies on non-traditional security issues to my work with an NGO tackling the intersection of gender, environment, and security, I�ve seen how climate pressures amplify existing inequalities. Without addressing these layers, adaptation efforts become fragmented and less impactful.

9,"To me, one of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the growing gap between global commitments and real implementation on the ground. While governments, institutions, and companies often make strong climate pledges, these commitments rarely translate into meaningful action at the scale or speed required. This �implementation gap� is especially harmful in regions like the Global South, where communities are already facing severe climate impacts but receive limited support to adapt, take example of COP29 and COP30.

A major driver of this gap is inequality in climate finance and decision-making. The countries and communities most vulnerable to climate change often have the least influence in global policy spaces and the least access to resources needed for adaptation and resilience. Promises of climate funding are slow, insufficient, or overly complicated, preventing local actors from responding effectively.

Another challenge is that climate action is still often treated as a technical issue rather than a human one. We cannot solve the crisis without addressing deeper issues such as poverty, governance, justice, and the inclusion of youth and marginalized groups. When these voices are missing, solutions become disconnected from real needs.

In short, the biggest challenge is not a lack of knowledge or solutions it is the lack of equity, political will, and practical support to turn solutions into action where they matter most.",0.64561415,0.45056015,0.6704111,0.858057786432816,#e51f1f

While global climate negotiations have produced ambitious pledges, these commitments often lack the monitoring and enforcement frameworks needed to translate them into tangible, timely action.

Many countries and corporations publicly commit to net-zero pathways or ambitious adaptation goals, yet reporting remains inconsistent, fragmented, or overly self-reported. Compliance is further weakened by the absence of strong accountability levers. International climate agreements rely heavily on voluntary reporting and peer pressure rather than binding compliance systems. At the national level, institutional capacity to monitor emissions, enforce regulations, or oversee adaptation plans is often limited, particularly in vulnerable regions where climate impacts are most severe. 

Overcoming this challenge requires investment in robust measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) frameworks, transparent climate data infrastructures, and governance innovations that incentivize or mandate compliance.

Many countries make ambitious climate pledges, but these often do not translate into policies, funding, or concrete plans fast enough.

This challenge is greater in the Global South. In Ghana, for example, communities face flooding, coastal erosion, extreme heat, water shortages, and pollution from illegal mining. These problems affect farming, health, and livelihoods, yet many communities lack the funding, knowledge, and tools needed to adapt or build long-term solutions.

Another challenge is the lack of involvement of local communities in decision-making. Policies are often made far from the people most affected, which can make solutions ineffective or hard to implement. Young people, who are driving many climate initiatives, are especially underrepresented.

To address this, we need stronger political will, better access to climate finance, and more inclusive decision-making. Climate action must focus on solutions that are practical, fair, and shaped by the people most affected.

13,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between global ambition and local reality. Policies, declarations, and pledges are being made at high levels, but the communities most affected, especially in Africa, often see little change on the ground.

In my region of northern Ghana, people understand the climate crisis because they live with it: they experience erratic rainfall, heatwaves, food insecurity, and crop losses. Yet they rarely have access to the knowledge, technology, or financing needed to adapt. This disconnect is not about lack of interest; it is about lack of inclusion and investment where it matters most.

Another challenge is the limited space for youth voices, despite young people comprising the majority of the population in the Global South. They are often involved at the advocacy level but excluded from designing and implementing solutions.

Lastly, climate education remains uneven, and without it, communities cannot participate fully in climate action. This is one reason I built STEM4ALL and the Climate Learning Hub to close that accessibility gap.

To overcome these challenges, we need climate solutions that are community-driven, youth-led, and grounded in reality, not just promises on paper. Climate action must become local before it can truly become global.",0.36165643,0.602443,0.5551461,0.6789436376837861,#f7e379

Policies and targets are becoming more ambitious, but the operational systems that shape emissions such as procurement, logistics, waste management, and transport, are still built around cost and speed, not environmental impact. As a result, even well-designed climate strategies often fail to translate into measurable change.

A second challenge is global inequality in climate readiness. Countries in the Global South, including many in the MENA region, face the highest exposure to pollution, extreme weather, and environmental degradation, yet have limited support to modernize their infrastructure or adopt renewable technologies. This slows down climate action where it is needed most.

Another barrier is the fragmented nature of climate governance. Chemicals management, waste policy, energy planning, health, and development are treated as separate issues, even though they are deeply interconnected. Without integrating these systems, especially in rapidly growing regions, climate solutions will remain incomplete.

Many communities most affected by climate change have little access to climate education, early warning information, or practical training on adaptation and resilience strategies. Young people, who make up the majority of Somalia�s population, are passionate about climate action but often lack pathways to build professional expertise in areas such as climate governance, research, environmental management, and policy advocacy. This capacity gap restricts meaningful participation in national and global climate decision-making.

Furthermore, many local institutions and civil society organizations struggle with limited resources for training their staff on climate risk analysis, environmental monitoring, or evidence-based climate programming.

Another major challenge is deforestation, driven by charcoal production, agricultural expansion and unsustainable land use. Zambia has one of the highest deforestation rates in Africa, which accelerates biodiversity loss, reduces carbon sinks and increases vulnerability to climate shocks. Limited access to affordable clean energy alternatives further fuels this problem.

Additionally, insufficient funding and limited technical capacity constrain large-scale climate adaptation and mitigation projects.

While the Global North dominates COP negotiations, finance commitments, and technology design, the communities facing immediate existential threats (small-island nations, Sahel farmers, Central Asian glacier-dependent societies, Indigenous Amazon guardians) remain observers rather than co-authors. This power asymmetry turns even the best-intended policies into top-down impositions that fail on the ground.

We see it clearly in water and land-use governance: trillions are pledged for �green transitions,� yet local youth, women, and Indigenous groups who hold traditional knowledge and daily reality checks are rarely in the room when adaptation funds are allocated or river-basin treaties are signed. The result is misdirected dams, carbon credits that displace communities, and early-warning systems nobody trusts because they were never co-designed.

This imbalance slows down action and leaves entire regions feeling unheard.
Another part of the problem is that climate policy often moves much slower than the science. We know what needs to happen, phase out fossil fuels, scale up renewable energy and invest in resilience but political interests, economic fearsand short election cycles keep pulling things backwards. Even when countries commit to bold targets, the follow ups are weak and inconsistent.

First, in many countries, the urgency of climate change has not been taken seriously until its consequences become unavoidable. For example, in Iran, we face severe water scarcity, air pollution, and other environmental predicaments. Decades of delayed action have left communities exposed to avoidable hardships, demonstrating how past inaction amplifies present vulnerability.
Second, the political atmosphere in key countries poses additional barriers. In the United States and elsewhere, the increasing push for deregulation and short-term economic priorities often conflicts with long-term climate goals. Shifts in government policy or leadership can reverse hard-won progress, making climate action fragmented and inconsistent across borders.
Third, effective climate action is hindered by insufficient access to measurable, high-quality data and a lack of transparency. Policymakers, businesses, and civil society need reliable information on emissions, supply chain risks, and environmental impacts to make informed decisions. Without standardized, transparent reporting, climate strategies may be ineffective or even counterproductive.",0.5450454,0.34258097,0.41370773,0.7825251746186075,#f3a134
25,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between global ambitions and the actual implementation of climate commitments. While governments announce targets such as net-zero pathways, renewable energy goals, and adaptation plans, these promises often remain slow, underfunded, or insufficiently coordinated. This gap is especially visible in developing countries, where climate impacts grow faster than the capacity to respond.
A major barrier is access to climate finance. Despite international commitments, funding mechanisms remain complex and often inaccessible for local actors. Communities in the Global South struggle to secure resources for renewable energy, adaptation, and resilience projects, delaying their transition and increasing inequalities.
Ensuring a just and inclusive transition is also essential. Climate policies can create social tensions if equity is overlooked. Vulnerable groups, workers in high-carbon sectors, and low-income households often face the highest climate risks with the least support to adapt. Without inclusion, climate progress risks being unequal and unstable.
Finally, misinformation and limited public engagement slow momentum. Many people still underestimate the urgency of the crisis or feel excluded from decision-making. Effective climate action must therefore be better financed, more inclusive, and accessible to all, ensuring no community is left behind.",0.823158,0.43210644,0.8167999,0.8364720478072152,#f3a134

27,"In my view, one of the greatest challenges for climate action today is the difficulty of achieving genuine cooperation among nations. Although there is broad recognition that climate change requires a global response, political and economic interests often prevail over collective responsibility, and different countries assume different levels of responsibility. As a result, agreements are signed but not fully implemented, creating a persistent gap between discourse and action.

International cooperation becomes even more complex when considering asymmetries in development, particularly between the Global North and the Global South. In many countries, especially in Latin America and Africa, climate discussions are not always aligned with urgent social and economic priorities. Means of action may be limited, while some nations hesitate to commit due to concerns over competitiveness and economic impact.

Therefore, I believe the central challenge is to build inclusive governance that protects national interests while promoting common goals, alongside programs that support development in the Global South. For climate action to be effective, a stronger diplomatic effort is essential, coupled with fair financing mechanisms and a renewed sense of multilateral responsibility capable of turning agreements into concrete and measurable actions.

We have plenty of climatetech and strategies mapped out on a planetary scale, from our transition to renewables to redesigning our food systems. But implementing and scaling them requires governments, markets, scientists, educators and society to compromise and move in the same direction. With the immense time pressure, it requires a high level of coordination that is incredibly hard in our increasingly fragmented society.

Financing is definitely one of the clearest bottlenecks. Climate adaptation projects in emerging markets are still severely underfunded. Data shows that investors care about sustainability, yet climate risks are still inconsistently priced into valuations, so capital doesn�t always flow to where it�s most needed. As a result, technical solutions dont see the light of day without finance.

But I think the hardest part of implementation is the human dimension. Global cooperation is so hard. The recent COP30 was another reminder of how difficult it is to reconcile collective climate goals with countries national interests. There was overwhelming evidence but countries still disagreed on a firm commitment to phase out fossil fuels. Plus, the climate has so much to do with identity, personal beliefs and ethics.

I see this constantly in my research. Municipalities want to buy sustainably, but they don't know how to write the tender specifications, how to evaluate if a supplier is really sustainable, or how to measure the impact. They have sustainability goals but no practical roadmap to reach them.
This problem is everywhere - companies want to be sustainable but don't know where to start. Cities declare climate emergencies but then continue business as usual because they lack concrete implementation tools.
Through my work with Italian municipalities, I've learned that when you work with people, like ""co-designing"" approach with the people, they actually start making changes. The motivation is there; what's missing is the practical knowledge.
Another challenge is context - a solution from Milan might not work in a smaller city or in Mongolia. We need to document what works WHERE and WHY, not just copy-paste solutions across different realities.
That's why I focus on the ""how"" in my research. I document the actual mechanisms, the real processes, the specific tools that municipalities use.

These issues are not only global�they directly affect communities in Ghana. In my experience with beach clean-ups in Ada, I�ve seen how plastic pollution and waste harm marine life and local livelihoods. This small-scale example mirrors a larger problem: when ecosystems are degraded, the consequences are felt far beyond the immediate area.

In Ghana, land degradation is particularly severe, destroying water bodies and forest reserves. The impacts are alarming: studies show higher levels of mercury and cyanide in crops, and in some areas, infants are being born with deformities linked to environmental toxins. These local realities highlight how climate change and human activities are creating health crises, food insecurity, and loss of biodiversity�not just in Ghana, but globally.

Addressing this challenge requires coordinated action, from community-level clean-ups like those in Ada to national policies protecting forests, rivers, and soil.

Communities in the Global South, including Pacific Islands, already experience sea level rise, extreme weather, and pressure on food and water, yet they still face complex rules and slow systems when trying to access climate finance and technical support.

This gap is driven by short term political and economic interests, weak accountability for climate promises and limited voice for vulnerable groups in decisions on energy, land, oceans and loss and damage. As long as those who are most affected have the least power in negotiations, climate policies will not match the urgency on the ground. Closing this gap means shifting public and private finance away from fossil fuels, setting clearer rules for accountability, and giving affected communities real influence over decisions, not only consultation.

34,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the lack of a shared understanding of what the most pressing issues are and how they intersect. Different actors often approach climate action from their own perspectives, applying individual assumptions to parts of the problem that are, in reality, not identical. This can lead to fragmented solutions, misplaced priorities, and missed opportunities for collaboration.

For example, in agriculture, some policymakers focus on reducing emissions through technological interventions, while local communities may prioritize soil health, water availability, or crop diversity. Both approaches are valid, but if they are treated as equivalent or pursued in isolation, the outcomes can be limited or even counterproductive. Similarly, global climate finance discussions often center on emission reduction metrics, while the communities most affected by loss and damage prioritize immediate resilience and adaptation needs. Without a common understanding of goals, contexts, and trade-offs, efforts risk talking past each other rather than building meaningful solutions.

Addressing this challenge requires dialogue that bridges local realities, scientific evidence, and policy frameworks. It calls for creating spaces where diverse perspectives are not only heard but understood, and where strategies are co-designed with recognition of the differences in scale, urgency, and impact.

Moreover, warlords and big business players are easily using greenwashing to cover their real ongoing damage to the environment and generations' resources. I can think of The European Green Deal as a great example, we can see how ambitious it seems, but it lacks a true political well and commitment from all stakeholders, because it was lost in the middle of vicious regional wars and 'national security' concerns over the Russian-Ukrainian war and the need to fund military capabilities instead of increasing green incentives or imposing carbon taxes for example.",0.89113116,0.22006226,0.37784314,0.6167204785398995,#f7e379

Transitioning these industries toward low carbon pathways requires not only technology but also financial mechanisms, marking incentives and international cooperation that recognize the unique constraints of developing nations. 

While renewable energy is being adopted at higher rates, the heavy industries pose a deeper challenge due to their high energy intensity and legacy infrastructure. CCUS is an expensive technology to adopt as financing is often limited. Also CBAM has a huge risk creating a trade disadvantage for Global South countries like T&T if we cannot adapt industrial processes to meet global low carbon standards and address climate action.

We often frame climate action as a technological or regulatory hurdle, but for the Global South, it is fundamentally a livelihood issue. The conflict lies in balancing immediate economic survival with long-term environmental goals.

Through my research on the gig economy, I see this tension firsthand. Digital platforms optimize logistics and reduce inefficiencies, but they often externalize environmental costs (like vehicle emissions) onto gig workers who lack the capital to transition to green alternatives, such as electric vehicles. The challenge is not just inventing green technology, but ensuring that the transition to a green economy does not exacerbate inequality or destroy the livelihoods of the precarious workforce.

We cannot achieve net-zero goals if the path requires the most vulnerable to pay the highest price. Therefore, the critical challenge is designing inclusive climate interventions�policies and business models that make sustainable practices the most profitable and accessible choice for micro-entrepreneurs and gig workers.

Limited access to information, resources, and practical solutions prevents meaningful participation.

Behavioral inertia and competing socio-economic priorities also hinder action. Many focus on immediate survival, leaving long-term environmental sustainability secondary. Without locally adapted, practical solutions, well-intentioned campaigns may be ignored. Weak regulation enforcement and insufficient funding further undermine national and global goals.

Many organizations and governments assume people will choose greener solutions, irrespective of cost. However, behavioural change does not happen in isolation. It is influenced by economic structures, affordability, and access where for many households, clean technologies remain a luxury even though they are environmentally desirable.
This is where governance becomes crucial. Policymaking often focuses on technological supply�renewables, green infrastructure, energy innovation�without understanding the behavioural and socioeconomic factors necessary for widespread adoption. Climate initiatives fail when they ignore deeply rooted inequalities, limited public trust, or lack of supportive institutions. Weak governance and short-term incentives make it harder to bring individual behaviour in line with national climate commitments.
The issue is not only about low-carbon technologies but also about governance systems that facilitate behavioural change from an economic, social, and institutional perspective. Climate action will accelerate only if policy designs account for people's realities�sustainable choices should not only be available, but viable.

Through the Ecoleaders project, which I lead, we are helping youth turn ideas into action�yet this needs broader systemic backing.
Second, equity is critical. Bangladesh contributes less than 0.3% of global emissions yet bears some of the highest climate risks. Without fair mechanisms for loss and damage, technology transfer, and just transition, climate action risks deepening global inequalities.

While international agendas, national policies, and high-level climate pledges continue to grow, the translation of these commitments into practical, community-level change remains slow, under-resourced, and uneven, especially in vulnerable regions like the Global South.
A key reason for this gap is that climate solutions are often designed without a deep understanding of local contexts, social dynamics, and existing vulnerabilities. Communities on the frontline, farmers, women, informal workers, elders, and those in fragile and conflict-prone areas are rarely included in decision-making, even though they face the most severe climate impacts. As a result, many interventions remain donor-driven, short-term, or poorly aligned with the realities on the ground.
Another challenge is the lack of accessible finance and technical capacity for low-income countries. Climate funding disproportionately flows to mitigation rather than adaptation, leaving the most climate-vulnerable populations without the resources they need. Meanwhile, data gaps, particularly in remote or conflict-affected areas, limit effective planning, early warning, and long-term resilience building.

In the Philippines, it�s a span of three years, and during that period, leaders seek quick and visible solutions to maintain their hold on power. Leaders who intend to look at a wider timeframe risk losing their position, or these initiatives will be halted when new leaders take over. This was my experience in one of our microgrid projects. We provided solar energy to 100 houses and public infrastructure in an upland community. We helped them establish an association for the management and maintenance of the system and assisted the local government in developing a long-term plan. Unfortunately, when the governor changed, the project halted, and the plans were changed.
From a young person�s perspective, this feels quite frustrating. While we see the unavoidable increase in global temperatures, many countries in the global South seem to still be at square one.

The lack of inclusiveness and support for locally-led climate solutions creates inequality in climate adaptation and slows meaningful progress.

To address this challenge, climate action must shift from being only policy-driven to being people-centered, inclusive, and accessible. We need climate solutions designed with and for communities, supported by funding, capacity building, and platforms where local experiences can inform national and global decisions.",0.5649774,0.53555256,0.9538946,0.7492571689420838,#f3a134
52,"With more than seven years of experience as a climate and environmental advocate, I have followed climate talks across international, multilateral, continental, regional, national and local levels. Each level offers a different view of how climate action is progressing.

At the international and continental stages, there is strong technical advancement in research, negotiations and policy design. These platforms set the ambition that should guide national efforts. At the national level, many governments have outlined plans that show an interest in addressing climate change, even if the momentum varies. At the local level, I have seen committed community actors and civil society organizations working hard to create meaningful impact despite limited resources.

Across these levels, one major challenge stands out. The biggest barrier to progress is the inability of governments to turn policies and plans into real, large-scale action. Many commitments remain on paper and are not followed by the urgency needed to match the scale of the crisis.

A clear example is the COP28 declaration in Dubai to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. While this was a strong and positive step, most governments have not taken concrete action to implement it. Because many of these declarations are non-binding, the political will to act remains low, and this slows the global response to climate change.",0.5663035,0.56611717,0.6182023,0.7471830365946611,#f3a134

While governments and international institutions have made ambitious pledges, implementation often remains disconnected from the lived experiences of those most affected by climate change. This gap is visible in the Global South, where climate impacts are intensifying but resources are limited. Communities are adapting out of necessity, while disinformation and a lack of climate knowledge communication make it harder to mobilise collective action. Moreover, climate policies are designed in technical ways that overlook the socio-cultural dimensions of climate change among people with intersectional identities. Without addressing justice and inclusion, climate policies risk reinforcing existing vulnerabilities instead of reducing them. Finally, climate action struggles with fragmentation: between sectors, between global and local priorities, and between the urgency of the crisis and the slow pace of policy processes. As a result, communities are left navigating overlapping crises beyond climate change, including socio-economic and digital inequities. To address these challenges, it requires stronger public engagement, clearer communication, and meaningful participation from those most affected, to ensure climate action is people-centred and leads to lasting change.",0.46996546,0.51128864,0.7337251,0.7902693587341493,#f3a134

For example, in Africa or countries from the Global South, economic challenges seem to be a great challenge. This is because new technologies for climate adaptation such as climate smart-agriculture need resources to implement.
-In addition, lack of knowledge concerning climate change by a number of people from the Global South is acting as a barrier to effective climate action. People are not willing to participate in initiatives that they are not well informed about in terms of causes, processes, effects today and in future. Therefore, there is need for knowledge sharing so that people will make informed decisions.
-Gender inequalities rooted in cultural norms and values stand to be hindering climate action as in many countries form Global South women are not fully participating in decision making processes and have little access to important resources such as land and also education.
-Poor governance and policies by leaders from Global South characterized by corruption obviously affect resource mobilization towards climate action initiatives.

-For countries from the Global North, failure by other countries to reform and commit themselves to climate action is delaying success of climate action.

While knowledge of climate risks and sustainable practices is widespread, translating this awareness into tangible action at local, national, and global levels remains difficult. Policies, funding mechanisms, and technological solutions exist, yet they often fail to reach or effectively engage communities, especially youth and marginalized groups who are most vulnerable to climate impacts. Another significant challenge is the unequal burden of climate change. Communities in the Global South, including Pakistan, face severe consequences from extreme weather, resource scarcity, and environmental degradation, despite contributing minimally to global emissions. This inequity complicates the balance between urgent adaptation needs and long-term mitigation strategies, as immediate survival often takes priority over sustainability.  From my experience leading awareness campaigns, coordinating climate initiatives, and engaging students and volunteers in sustainable projects, I have seen that empowering people with knowledge, tools, and agency is critical to converting awareness into concrete climate action.

Climate change is already transforming life for many Nigerian communities through flooding, heatwaves, erosion, and declining food security, yet these experiences seldom influence how policies are created. We hear much about adaptation plans and financial mechanisms, but the people most affected are often absent from the conversations. In Nigeria, climate stress does not occur in isolation. It intersects with weak infrastructure, irregular urban planning, overstretched public services, and deep social inequalities. When flooding prevents children in Bayelsa from attending school or when extreme heat forces informal workers to reduce their daily hours, the core issue is not solely the climate event. It is the absence of a governance system that safeguards the most vulnerable. Climate action struggles when it fails to address these structural issues. Another challenge is representation. Nigeria faces significant climate risks but has limited influence over global climate decisions. When countries with low emissions have little voice in shaping solutions, the resulting policies often fail to address local needs. There is also the issue of trust. Many Nigerians do not feel that climate funding or government plans reach the communities that need them most.

Countries have made strong pledges through the Paris Agreement, NDCs, and global adaptation frameworks, but the pace of real on-the-ground action remains too slow to match the scale of climate impacts.

A key driver of this gap is the persistent inequity in climate finance, especially for adaptation. While climate impacts disproportionately affect the Global South, the resources needed to strengthen adaptation finance, technology, and institutional capacity are still limited, unpredictable, or difficult to access. This makes it harder for communities to adapt, for governments to implement plans, and for youth and civil society groups to participate meaningfully in decision-making.

Another challenge is the disconnect between global policy discussions and local realities. Important decisions are often made in international spaces far removed from the people experiencing climate impacts. As a result, solutions may overlook local knowledge, water governance needs, gender dynamics, youth perspectives, and community-led innovations.

60,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between high-level climate ambition and real-world implementation. Policies and targets are becoming more ambitious, but the operational systems that shape emissions; procurement, logistics, waste management, and transport, are still built around cost and speed, not environmental impact. As a result, even well-designed climate strategies often fail to translate into measurable change.

A second challenge is global inequality in climate readiness. Countries in the Global South, including many in the MENA region, face the highest exposure to pollution, extreme weather, and environmental degradation, yet have limited support to modernize their infrastructure or adopt renewable technologies. This slows down climate action where it is needed most.

Another barrier is the fragmented nature of climate governance. Chemicals management, waste policy, energy planning, health, and development are treated as separate issues, even though they are deeply interconnected. Without integrating these systems, especially in rapidly growing regions, climate solutions will remain incomplete.

Finally, climate action is hindered by limited participation from frontline sectors. Logistics, procurement, and humanitarian operations hold enormous potential to reduce emissions and pollution, yet they are often missing from climate conversations.

A major reason for this gap is limited accessibility and usability of climate information, especially for vulnerable communities and local decision-makers. High-quality data exists, but it often remains locked in technical reports, complex models, or institutions that lack the mechanisms to communicate findings effectively. As a result, farmers, urban planners, and local authorities those most exposed to climate risks struggle to make timely, informed decisions.

Another part of the challenge is political and economic inertia. Short-term interests, fragmented governance, and insufficient investment delay transitions in agriculture, water management, and energy systems, even when the scientific evidence is clear.

62,"From my experience in climate advocacy so far, I will say it is the lack of genuine awareness in society. Many people hear about climate change, but very few truly understand how it affects their daily lives whether through extreme heat, rising food prices, pollution, or flooding. Because the issue feels distant, it becomes difficult to inspire consistent action or community participation.
This low level of awareness leads to another challenge and that�s climate issues are often not seen as a priority. In places like Nigeria, people are dealing with immediate concerns such as unemployment, insecurity, and rising living costs. As a result, environmental issues are pushed to the background, even though their impacts are already shaping health, agriculture, and livelihoods. Without clear understanding, people struggle to connect these problems to climate change.
And I think this is a result of insufficient public education and communication. Climate messages often remain technical, urban centered, or targeted at the already informed in the society which shouldn�t be. Rural communities, students, local traders, and even young people rarely have access to simplified, culturally relevant information that can help them take action.
When citizens are not fully informed, it becomes harder to demand accountability or influence decision-making.

Despite overwhelming scientific evidence and escalating climate impacts, coordinated action is undermined by competing interests. Influential leaders deny climate change or prioritise short-term national agendas, while countries prioritise energy security over sustainability.

This is compounded by the persistent divide between developed and developing nations. Developed countries often shape the global climate agenda, yet developing nations face structural barriers to finance, technology, and capacity-building support. The result is an uneven playing field, where the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts are the least empowered to implement solutions.

Geopolitical self-interest also dominates multilateral discussions, slowing consensus on critical issues such as decarbonisation and equitable climate finance. The lack of a unified purpose not only stalls progress but risks eroding trust among nations who are already facing existential climate risks.

Ultimately, the biggest challenge is political will, and the collective vision, to treat climate action not as a peripheral policy issue, but an urgent, shared responsibility that transcends borders.

Fast urban expansion, economic pressure, and fragmented decision-making make it difficult for environmental priorities to influence long-term development.

In my work across commercial, residential, landscape, urban, and master planning projects, I have witnessed how sustainable design ideas are frequently acknowledged but not consistently practiced. Stakeholders often operate in separate spheres, communities may lack understanding of environmental risks, and short-term goals tend to overshadow resilience-focused planning.

I believe the greatest challenge is building a unified, collaborative approach where researchers, architects, planners, policymakers, and local communities work together with shared responsibility.

For me, climate action has to be economically viable to be sustainable. If we really want people to shift, the transition needs to be worth it�financially, socially, and practically. Concepts and strategies are important, but they aren�t enough on their own. We need to build on what already exists, integrate current practices into new models, and make the transition attractive rather than burdensome.

Another major challenge is agriculture and food security. It�s one of the sectors most exposed to climate change, and yet the systems supporting it are often outdated or fragmented. Farmers need reliable, accessible monitoring systems�whether through digital tools, early-warning systems, or better data�to adapt to the changes happening around them.

This challenge connects directly to my master�s thesis, where I studied how dynamic norm information can encourage climate-friendly behaviour. My research showed that people are more likely to act when they see others around them taking action, emphasizing the importance of communication, trust, and social influence.

Addressing this challenge requires not only clear, transparent policies but also strategies to foster behavioural and cultural change, counter misinformation, and increase public legitimacy.

Capacity constraints also slow progress. Many countries lack the technical resources, research tools, and institutional support needed to design and implement effective climate strategies. This is why initiatives like Ideas Lab, which strengthen skills and expand networks, are so valuable.

81,"The greatest challenge to climate action today is in my opinion two-fold, that is declining political will and uncoordinated global effort. The effects of climate change are felt universally. However, some countries have contributed more to global emissions than others. The countries with lower contributions to global emissions are seen to suffer more from climate change. There is a thus a push and pull on who should be most involved in climate action. Politically for example, at the start of 2025, the United States administration made its intentions to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Media reported that President Trump also intended to approve new drilling and new pipelines. Uganda has also been faced with criticism for its dependence on fossil fuels especially with the plans for exploration of the newly discovered reserves. These examples from the United States (a developed country) and Uganda (a developing country) undermine the efforts discussed at the Conference of Parties (COP) to facilitate a global transition from fossil fuels. They show the discoordination in global efforts towards climate action. Without coordination, the wins of certain countries are continuously watered down by the inaction in other countries. 
In Uganda for example, there seems to be a lack of clear definition of roles and responsibilities hindering decision making, reporting and tracking.

I believe the most significant challenge is the ""justice and implementation gap."" While technology and policy frameworks exist, we are failing to ensure a just, equitable, and locally relevant transition. The impacts of climate change and the costs of adaptation are disproportionately borne by the most vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, who contribute the least to the problem.

84,"For me, the biggest challenge in climate action today is the gap between high-level commitments and what actually reaches communities on the ground. I see this every day in my work with small-scale farmers. Many of them know the climate is changing, but they don�t have access to reliable information, practical training, or the basic tools that would help them adapt. Even when policies sound good on paper, the support rarely filters down in a way that fits their realities.
Another challenge I�ve experienced is that climate funding is often complicated, slow, and geared toward large organizations. Community groups or youth-led initiatives like ours at the Polly Foundation struggle to access even small grants that could make a big difference.
There�s also a disconnect between technical climate processes and the people meant to benefit from them. For example, in standards work with ISO, KEBS, and SBTi, I often see how complex terminology and frameworks can discourage smaller actors from participating or even understanding how these systems affect them.
Finally, youth engagement has improved, but young people are still invited mostly for visibility rather than for real decision-making. It�s hard to drive meaningful change when young people have energy and ideas but limited influence over budgets or policies.
So in my view, the challenge isn�t a lack of ideas but rather it�s the difficulty of turning commitments into practical, accessible, and community-centered action.",0.39341927,0.5284241,0.49803185,0.746626049367919,#f3a134
85,"For me, one of the biggest challenges in climate action today is the painful gap between what the world promises and what actually reaches the people who need help the most. Coming from West Africa, I have seen how climate change affects everyday life, not through big headlines, but through rising food prices, unpredictable weather that threatens livelihoods, and the quiet struggles of communities with very limited support systems. Global commitments like the Paris Agreement sound ambitious, yet the resources needed to implement them rarely trickle down to the most vulnerable.

This disconnect makes climate change feel like an unfair burden on communities that contribute the least to the crisis. Young people, especially women and those in informal settlements, face the harshest consequences but are almost never invited into the spaces where solutions are being designed. Their lived experiences are treated as footnotes instead of guiding voices.

Another challenge I see is that climate policy discussions often happen far away from the realities of those directly affected. Solutions are developed with good intentions but without the cultural, social, or economic context needed for them to work on the ground.

Finally, political hesitation, misinformation, and short-term economic priorities make it difficult to act with the urgency the moment demands.

Empowering youth to understand climate risks and make responsible decisions is therefore a critical challenge. Through awareness programs and innovative tools such as Virtual Reality, young people can visualize the link between environmental pressures and migration, make informed choices, and strengthen resilience within their communities.

Countries, institutions, and corporations often make ambitious pledges, yet these commitments rarely translate into the scale, speed, or consistency required to keep warming within 1.5�C.

First is inadequate financing. Many vulnerable regions, especially in the Global South, lack the resources to transition to clean energy, build resilient infrastructure, or respond to climate shocks. Without predictable and accessible climate finance, even the most well-designed plans stall.

Second is political hesitation. Climate policies often clash with short-term economic or electoral interests. As a result, leaders delay tough decisions such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies or enforcing emissions standards, even when the science is clear.

Third is the lack of integration across sectors. Climate impacts cut across energy, agriculture, health, and security, but many responses remain siloed. This limits the kind of transformative change needed to address the crisis.

92,"In Malawi, one of the biggest challenges for climate action is the lack of affordable and accessible alternatives to charcoal and firewood. Most households cannot afford gas, electric stoves, or other clean cooking technologies, so they continue to depend on wood-based fuel for daily cooking. Even when people understand the impact of deforestation, the cost of cleaner options is simply out of reach.

Poverty also forces many young people to produce and sell charcoal as a source of income. For families with no stable employment, charcoal-making becomes one of the quickest ways to earn money, even though it destroys forests. Without real economic alternatives, communities will keep cutting trees faster than they are replanted.

Another challenge is the lack of interest in tree-planting as a continuous habit. Many people see it as a one-day activity rather than something to maintain until seedlings survive. This mindset leads to low survival rates and limited long-term impact.

Weak enforcement of forestry laws and limited community ownership over forests also make it difficult to protect areas like Chikangawa Forest and Kasasile Village, which were once heavily forested but have now lost most of their trees.

This creates a major implementation gap: climate policies sound ambitious, yet often fail on the ground because they overlook cultural context, community governance, and lived resilience.

Another challenge is the extractive way knowledge is collected. Indigenous practices are documented, analysed elsewhere, and returned without meaningful community participation. This weakens trust and prevents solutions from becoming locally rooted and long-lasting.

Much of the climate discourse remains highly technical and rarely translated into vernacular languages, leaving rural and indigenous communities excluded from processes that directly impact their lives.

Financing also remains a major barrier. While global climate finance has expanded, it often fails to reach grassroots and community-led initiatives in the Mekong. Funding mechanisms are complex, bureaucratic, and tailored to large institutions rather than local actors. As a result, countries with high vulnerability but limited capacity remain dependent on fragmented, project-based financing that does not support long-term resilience or rights-based approaches.

There is a lot of knowledge, many reports, and many conferences, but there is still a large gap between global decisions and the concrete lives of people who depend on rivers, beaches, coastal areas, and natural resources to survive.

In the most vulnerable countries, especially small island states like S�o Tom� and Pr�ncipe, this gap becomes even wider. Communities want to participate, they are interested in and feel the effects of climate change, but they don't always have access to the information, resources, or institutional support necessary to act. There is a lack of technical capacity, a lack of funding adapted to local realities, and, above all, a lack of genuine involvement of young people and communities in solutions.

I see this clearly on the ground, through my community work: many people want to contribute, but the lack of structure, monitoring, and continuity means that good initiatives are lost.

This implementation gap is reinforced by unequal responsibilities: developed nations have historically contributed the most emissions, while developing countries bear disproportionate impacts and lack sufficient financing to adapt or transition to clean energy. Without strong climate finance mechanisms, vulnerable communities remain trapped in climate disasters, prioritizing survival over long-term sustainability.

Finally, misinformation and political resistance slow down public support for climate policies. Although science is clear, some industries and political groups still undermine climate solutions to protect their interests.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and actual implementation. Although many people understand that climate change is a serious issue, translating this awareness into coordinated, long-term action often fails due to limited resources, weak policy enforcement, and competing social and economic priorities.

In many developing countries, for example, climate action competes with urgent needs such as employment, healthcare, and access to basic services. Even when communities want to adopt sustainable practices, the lack of financial support, technology, and infrastructure slows progress. This is especially true in rural areas where climate impacts such as droughts, floods, and unpredictable seasons hit hardest but resources for adaptation are limited.

Another major challenge is the lack of global cooperation and accountability. Wealthier nations contribute more to global emissions but slow progress on commitments, while vulnerable countries face the consequences without sufficient support. This imbalance creates frustration and slows momentum for meaningful global action.

Finally, misinformation and limited climate education make it harder for communities to understand the urgency of the crisis and the solutions available to them.

146,"In my opinion, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the lack of seriousness and collective responsibility from governments and institutions. Despite the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, such as floods and heatwaves, many governments fail to prioritize climate action.

In Pakistan, I've witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of climate disasters on communities. Every year, hundreds of lives are lost, and thousands are displaced due to floods and other extreme weather events. Unfortunately, climate issues are often perceived through a religious lens rather than a scientific one, which hinders effective action.

Moreover, awareness campaigns are limited, and many people remain uninformed about the severity of the climate crisis. Without a sense of urgency and understanding, it's challenging to mobilize communities to take action.",0.30572653,0.43669772,0.7559085,0.6939946290163262,#f7e379
147,The biggest challenge for the climate action particularly in the global South is the prioritisation of funds for other social-economic challenges that still pester the global South.

148,"The gap between global ambition and local implementation, especially in the Global South. While international agreements set strong targets, the systems needed to deliver them�data, financing, governance, and infrastructure�remain deeply unequal.
One major barrier is the lack of reliable, accessible data. Without accurate environmental, waste, or emissions data, governments cannot design effective policies, and businesses cannot measure or manage their impact. This leads to weak enforcement, greenwashing, and slow adoption of circular practices. In many African countries, climate action depends heavily on informal systems or manual processes, limiting transparency and accountability.
A second challenge is unequal climate financing. The communities most affected by climate change often receive the least support. Local innovators, waste workers, and small manufacturers are rarely included in conversations about climate solutions, yet they hold essential knowledge.
Finally, climate action struggles because it is often approached in silos. Real transformation requires cross-sector collaboration�policy, technology, communities, industry, and finance working together. Without integration, even the best policies fail to reach the ground.

My research with small-scale farming and fishing households in sub-Saharan Africa highlights two overlooked dimensions: gender differences and mental wellbeing.

Climate responses often treat communities as uniform, ignoring how gender shapes exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. Young women, for instance, face distinct livelihood risks, food security pressures, and emotional burdens that current policies rarely address.

Mental wellbeing is also missing from climate strategies. Climate-driven livelihood loss and food insecurity create stress, anxiety, and emotional strain, yet these impacts remain invisible in adaptation planning.

Bridging these gaps is essential for climate action that is effective, equitable, and truly sustainable.",0.5891588,0.5516349,0.8148999,0.5981888445198781,#f7e379

In my experience coordinating proposals across sectors, I see firsthand how this fragmentation limits impact. Rising temperatures, shifting vector-borne disease patterns, food insecurity and pressure on fragile health systems show that climate change is fundamentally a health crisis, yet funding systems are often rigidly divided. This separation results in climate programs that overlook community health resilience, and health programs that are not climate-proofed. Financial and institutional architecture of prevent the integration of technical solutions from being scaled. A major barrier is the way calls for proposals separate health and environment under distinct mandate, discouraging collaboration even when solutions require it. To address this, we need financing mechanisms that incentivize integrated climate-health models and acknowledge that resilience is multi-dimensional. Breaking down these silos is essential for moving from reactive to transformative climate action, particularly in regions where vulnerabilities overlap.",0.5579145,0.48434263,0.7478181,0.6326653846547866,#f7e379
151,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between high-level commitments and real change on the ground, especially in vulnerable countries. We hear many ambitious pledges, but communities facing droughts, floods, displacement and food insecurity often see very little support, information or participation in decisions that affect them.

This gap is made worse by unequal power and resources. Those who contribute least to climate change, like many communities in the Global South, are the most affected but have the weakest access to finance, data, technology and policymaking spaces. At the same time, climate discussions can be highly technical and dominated by a small circle of experts and negotiators.

Another challenge is that climate action is still treated as a �sector� instead of a cross-cutting priority linked to peace, jobs, migration, health, and digital transformation. This leads to fragmented projects that do not address root causes or long-term resilience.

To close this gap, we need climate governance that is more inclusive, locally-driven and transparent, with climate finance reaching frontline communities, and stronger bridges between global policies and local realities. Young people, especially from the Global South, can help build these bridges through advocacy, storytelling, research and innovative solutions.",0.52482533,0.5116286,0.9363048,0.7278566456251553,#f3a134
152,"The most formidable challenge for climate action today is the systemic misalignment between short-term political and economic incentives and the long-term, global nature of the climate crisis. While technological solutions advance, our governance structures and markets remain largely geared toward incremental, nationally-focused gains, failing to account for the planetary-scale costs of inaction.

This misalignment manifests in two critical ways. First, it creates a pervasive ""free-rider"" problem in international diplomacy, where nations delay ambitious cuts, anticipating others will bear the economic burden. Second, and more profoundly, it exacerbates global injustice. The impacts of climate change�such as the climate migration I have researched�disproportionately affect those in the Global South who have contributed least to the problem, while the largest historical emitters often shield themselves from the immediate consequences.

Overcoming this requires more than just green technology; it demands a fundamental restructuring of our political and economic institutions to prioritize long-term resilience and equity. This means embedding ethical responsibilities, such as supporting climate refugees and financing a just transition in vulnerable nations, into the core of international agreements and domestic policies. Without this foundational shift, even the most promising technical solutions will be undermined by a system that does not value their full implementation.",0.55306435,0.3994369,0.6492461,0.7437141222878311,#f3a134

While many communities understand that climate change is happening, they often lack the resources, technology, and support systems needed to adopt cleaner and more sustainable practices. This is especially true in areas where people depend on traditional fuels, informal waste disposal, and limited infrastructure, not because they prefer them, but because alternatives remain inaccessible or expensive.

Another major challenge is the disconnect between policy and implementation. Governments and global institutions often design strong climate policies, but these do not always translate into concrete actions that reach households, informal settlements, and vulnerable populations. As a result, climate action becomes something discussed at high levels but not felt in daily life.

Additionally, climate action struggles with insufficient youth engagement, even though young people are among the most affected. Many youth have ideas and energy but lack platforms, mentorship, or funding to scale their solutions.

In 2017, heavy rainfall and flooding left many without adequate nutrition and led to significant loss of life, exposing a critical gap between policy intentions and on-the-ground realities. 
This gap in the difficulty of translating climate policies into effective local action is one of the biggest challenges for climate action today. While national and international frameworks outline ambitious targets, vulnerable communities often lack the resources, infrastructure, and knowledge to implement these strategies effectively. 
Bridging this gap requires approaches that combine policy, innovation, and community engagement. Integrating scientific research with traditional knowledge, empowering youth and local actors to participate in decision-making, and ensuring access to technology and funding are critical steps.

156,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. Many people understand that climate change is a serious issue, but translating this awareness into consistent, collective action remains difficult. This gap is driven by limited resources, weak policy enforcement, and the lack of accessible climate education, especially in developing countries.

Another major challenge is that climate impacts�such as extreme weather, droughts, and rising costs of living�often hit vulnerable communities the hardest. These communities have the least resources to adapt, making climate action seem secondary to daily survival needs. As a result, long-term environmental solutions are overshadowed by immediate economic pressures.

Additionally, coordination among governments, private sector actors, and communities is still weak. Policies may exist, but without proper funding, political will, or community participation, progress remains slow. There is also a lack of support for youth-led initiatives, even though young people are some of the strongest drivers of climate advocacy.

Advanced technologies and climate science provide detailed information, from satellite monitoring to predictive models, but this knowledge often remains inaccessible or too complex for local decision-makers. Farmers, policymakers, and urban planners need clear, actionable guidance to adapt and mitigate climate risks effectively.

Limited resources, infrastructure gaps, and fragmented information systems make it even harder to act on climate data, particularly in vulnerable regions. Without tools that translate complex information into locally relevant actions, opportunities for sustainable practices are missed and resilience is slowed.

Through my personal project KilimoTek, I worked on integrating geospatial analytics, field observations, and advisory dashboards to help farmers and decision-makers respond to climate challenges. Scaling solutions like this requires collaboration between technology experts, policymakers, and communities to ensure that climate action is both informed and equitable.

Awareness is not just about knowing what climate change is  it is about understanding the consequences on health, water, food security, air quality, and long-term stability.

In Iraq, for example, people are living through extreme heat, worsening air pollution, water scarcity, and continuous dust storms, yet public engagement in climate solutions remains limited. Without awareness, communities struggle to adopt sustainable behaviors, demand policy changes, or support environmental initiatives. This lack of awareness also impacts recycling, waste management, and circular economy efforts areas where Iraq still has almost no established systems.

Awareness influences everything: political will, community participation, funding priorities, and the success of local projects. When people understand climate issues, they become part of the solution rather than passive observers.

Another major obstacle is the social dimension of climate change. Communities with the least power especially in the Global South, face the worst consequences despite contributing the least to global emissions. When climate policies fail to consider inequality, they become harder to implement and easier to resist. Effective action therefore requires trust, fairness, and inclusive decision-making, not just technological solutions. Public communication is also a challenge.

Another major challenge is climate inequality, which affects youth and women the most. Rural communities, smallholder farmers, and women-led households face droughts, floods, and land degradation, yet they often lack access to climate information, technology, and decision-making platforms. Globally, similar inequities limit the effectiveness of national and international strategies.

Low awareness and limited behavioral change also make it hard to adopt sustainable practices. Without education, incentives, and engagement, youth and women the groups most capable of driving change cannot fully participate in climate solutions.

When income, food, and unstable services are pressing issues, things like waste sorting or cleaner energy fall to the background.

Weak and inconsistent systems deepen this gap. You can�t expect households to manage waste responsibly when collection is unreliable, or ask communities to adopt sustainable options when they are too expensive or hard to access. Without supportive infrastructure, willingness alone isn�t enough.

From my experience, trust is another part of this same challenge. People doubt that their small efforts matter when they don�t see government agencies or private players leading with the same commitment. This weakens the sense of shared responsibility.

Young people also struggle to move from passion to real influence. They participate in cleanups and campaigns, but are often excluded from decision-making spaces where long-term solutions are shaped.

This manifests in two ways:
Policy Imbalance and Protectionism: EU-driven policies, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), threaten to impose substantial, disproportionate financial burdens on African producers. Because many African nations, including Nigeria, lack the established systems for monitoring and measuring carbon content, producers could be assessed at higher default emissions rates, resulting in higher tariffs on exports like iron and steel (up to an 8.2% projected fall in exports). This risk creates a barrier to trade and investment, fundamentally undermining the economic resilience needed for climate adaptation.
Failure to Integrate Digital Solutions at Scale: Climate resilience requires rapid technological deployment, yet the global effort often overlooks the systemic need for capacity and security. In Nigeria, for instance, we see a massive opportunity for AI-driven early warning systems for climate resilience and just transition, but this progress is stunted by pervasive low digital literacy and a lack of investment in local ""green skills"" capacity, a failure that disproportionately affects youth and women.

The consequences of these climatic events are extensive, negatively influencing households, agriculture, tourism, and local industries, thereby affecting the economy broadly. In Tunisia, drought represents a chronic and structural problem, where regular water shortages and decreasing dam levels considerably threaten food production, public health, and overall quality of life. The combination of extreme heat, reduced rainfall, and poor water management aggravates the country�s vulnerability. This situation emphasizes a substantial gap between ambitious climate goals and the actual capacity to adapt to these changes.

A key aspect of this challenge is youth engagement and equity. Many competitive climate programs mainly benefit youth from developed countries who have early access to climate education and resources. Young people from small developing nations like Eswatini often face barriers to participation, limiting their exposure to knowledge, networks and opportunities to lead climate initiatives locally. This gap makes it harder for under-resourced youth to contribute to global climate solutions or bring back skills to their communities.

Climate impacts are increasingly interconnected, affecting water, agriculture and livelihoods.

One of the biggest challenges facing climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. Many people understand that climate change is real, but turning this awareness into consistent, large-scale action remains difficult.

Firstly, lack of political will and inconsistent policies slows down progress. Governments often make ambitious climate commitments, but these promises are rarely matched with strong laws, enforcement, or sufficient funding. Sometimes leaders prioritize short-term economic interests over long-term sustainability, delaying necessary transitions in energy, agriculture, and transportation.

Secondly, financial barriers limit climate action, especially in developing countries. While the world has the knowledge and technology to reduce emissions, many communities still lack access to affordable renewable energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and funding for adaptation. Without equitable financial support, the effects of climate change hit vulnerable populations the hardest.

Another major challenge is misinformation and low public engagement. Climate science is often misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented, creating confusion and slowing collective action. 

Finally, the scale and speed required to address climate change is unprecedented. Transitioning entire economies to clean energy, changing consumption patterns, restoring ecosystems, and adapting to rising risks must all happen simultaneously.

However, the summit failed to deliver clear commitments on phasing out fossil fuels and tackling deforestation. Without these structural changes, the drivers of climate change remain largely unaddressed, leaving communities in the Global South exposed to escalating threats such as flooding, waste mismanagement, heat stress, and water scarcity.

This is why, when I spoke at the Southeast LCOY conference, I highlighted communities like Ugwuaji Aku, sharing how grassroots climate initiatives such as tree planting, recycling, and intergenerational climate dialogues can directly improve resilience and literacy. I emphasized that without translating global agreements into locally relevant action, climate targets remain aspirational rather than real.

Second, policy frameworks often fall behind innovation, where in many emerging markets, regulations are either outdated or lack the specific incentives, such as tax breaks or subsidies, needed to make green technologies competitive against fossil fuels.

Finally, this is compounded by a lack of technical capacity. Even with funding and policy in place, we cannot transition to a green economy without the ""human infrastructure"" of the engineers, data analysts, and EV mechanics required to build and maintain these systems.

209,"The most significant challenge for climate action today is the pervasive ""action gap"" between high-level policy and tangible, community-level implementation. While global agreements and technological roadmaps are crucial, they often fail to account for the intricate socio-economic realities on the ground.

In my work across Southern Africa, I've witnessed how top-down solutions can falter when they don't align with local needs, knowledge, and immediate survival priorities. For a farmer in Zambia facing drought, climate action cannot be an abstract concept; it must offer a direct path to food security and income. This disconnect fuels inertia and a perceived trade-off between development and sustainability.

Bridging this gap requires moving beyond mere awareness to fostering deep, localized ownership. The real challenge is not a lack of solutions, but a lack of contextualized frameworks that empower communities to be co-designers of their resilience.

210,"I believe one of the biggest challenges for climate action today is inequity social, economic and cultural barriers that prevent the most vulnerable communities from participating meaningfully or benefiting from climate solutions. In many rural areas, like those in Zimbabwe and across Africa, there is limited awareness and education about climate change, its impacts, and adaptive practices. Without clear information or understanding, many smallholder farmers may not adopt climate-smart farming, conservation agriculture, or water-management strategies.
Beyond awareness, inequality and marginalisation mean that even when solutions are available, they are not always accessible to everyone especially women, youth, or marginalised communities. In some cases, climate policies and programmes are designed without engaging local voices or respecting traditional knowledge about land, water or resource management. 
Finally, social norms, cultural resistance or mistrust can slow uptake of new practices: whether it�s shifting to drought-tolerant crops, changing water usage habits, or trusting early-warning and adaptation advice.
Until climate action more fully addresses these equity, awareness and inclusion challenges � and centres local communities as active participants rather than just beneficiaries � many adaptation and mitigation efforts will remain patchy and fail to reach those who need them most.",0.57059884,0.5015279,0.47364724,0.689002287492183,#f7e379

While research provides clear evidence of environmental risks, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate vulnerabilities, translating this knowledge into actionable policies remains a critical hurdle. Many communities, especially in the Global South, experience climate impacts directly yet lack the infrastructure, resources, or political representation to implement effective solutions.

Another major challenge is ensuring equity and inclusion in climate decision-making. Solutions often emerge in global forums or from high-income countries, but they may not fully consider local contexts, social realities, or the voices of those most vulnerable. Without meaningful participation from affected communities and the integration of local scientific expertise, policies risk being ineffective or unsustainable.

Finally, misinformation and limited public understanding of climate science hinder collective action. As scientific evidence becomes increasingly complex, communicating clear, accessible, and actionable information to decision-makers and the public is essential.

Climate impacts are no longer abstract; they are directly reshaping people�s daily lives. Water sources are drying, agricultural land is degrading, and communities are increasingly unable to meet their basic needs. This scarcity is not only an environmental challenge but a security and stability threat, deepening inequality, fueling displacement, and placing immense pressure on fragile systems. 
The MENA region, which imports over half of its food and is one of the most water-stressed regions in the world, is particularly vulnerable. When water becomes scarce, and food becomes unaffordable, young people feel the consequences first: loss of livelihoods, heightened social tensions, and shrinking civic space. Yet these issues remain under-addressed in global climate discussions, often overshadowed by more technical debates.
Climate action today must therefore prioritize just, community-centered solutions that protect water resources, support sustainable agriculture, and integrate local knowledge. It must also recognize how environmental degradation intersects with peace, governance, and human rights.
As a youth advocate working on environmental governance and the WFW nexus, I believe that tackling this challenge requires empowering young people to co-create resilient food systems and equitable water policies. ",0.46756053,0.42373765,0.6221074,0.4924267343226166,#bbdb43

In my experience, I have seen the deep disconnect between ambitious goals and the resources, governance, and institutional capacity needed to realize them, especially in the Global South. Too many countries continue to produce climate pledges but lack the financial and technical capacity to implement them. For instance, Nigeria recently was the first in West Africa to release its NDC 3.0. However, there is no clear road map to mobilizing resources to achieve these commitments in a country where fossil fuels account for about 80% of its energy mix currently and a chunk of the population lacks access to electricity.

Many people understand the urgency of climate change, yet turning this awareness into practical action�especially at community level�remains slow due to limited funding, weak institutional capacity, and lack of access to technology in vulnerable regions.

Climate inequality also slows progress. Communities that contribute the least to global emissions are often the most affected by droughts, floods, and extreme weather, yet they receive minimal climate finance and support. This leaves those most vulnerable with the fewest tools to respond.

Misinformation and weak climate communication further hinder action. Many people do not fully understand climate science or how their daily choices impact the environment. Without clear, accessible education, it becomes difficult to build the widespread participation needed.

Additionally, weak policy enforcement and inconsistent political will remain major obstacles. Even strong environmental policies often fail due to limited coordination, insufficient resources, or competing national priorities.

Global inequity also poses a barrier. Countries in the Global South, which contribute least to emissions, face the worst impacts, while wealthier nations often fail to provide promised support.

One of the core issues is the increasing amount of loss and damage that is vulnerable populations experience which bears the brunt of the effects of climate events yet they are not contributing to the underlying crisis to the same extent. Recovery, adaptation, and resilience support is still slow, insufficient and unevenly distributed.

The issues of delayed policy discussions, conflicting economic needs, and lack of sufficient funding towards climate action are also impediments to climate action. Whereas sustainable alternatives are well knowledgeable, their application is on an ad hoc basis and long term commitments often fail.

Worldwide, over 3.3 billion people are living in climate exposed areas. However, below 10% of climate funding made it to local levels (UNCDF) . Over 70% of the plastic waste in sub-Saharan Africa is not disposed of in the right way. More than 400,000 people every year die from the burning of substances in the air.

In Nigeria, for instance, where petroleum is still the major revenue-generating sector, transition to renewable energy presents economic, political, and technical challenges. Most leaders and policymakers are faced with the difficult decision of safeguarding the environment or protecting the economy through revenue generation. This creates the implementation gap. 

Another major challenge to take note of is that these agreements and climate actions are developed as a one-size-fits-all solution without taking into consideration the local realities of the many regions involved. This results in policies being effective in one region and failing in the other. Most communities bearing the burden of these issues, from flooding to extreme temperatures, are mostly not carried along in the policy formation process.

233,"For this, I would like to borrow a couple of concepts from behavioral science that sort of drive human decision making and I see relevant with implementing right actions for climate - 
First is 'present bias' which refers to various cognitive biases that distort our perception and judgment of time: people irrationally favor immediate rewards over future benefits. This is why when retirement savings were made 'opt-out' in historic experiments, more people had savings for their retirement and depended less on social security. I believe a similar pattern exists with climate - where people tend to dismiss the future repercussions from the harmful actions being done now - having a bias for the present over the future. 

Another is �satisficing� - Celebrated economist Richard Thaler once said 'People aren't dumb. The world is hard'. We do have the technology and actions that we know can save the planet if followed correctly. But because humans constantly have to make lots of hard decisions in many complicated situations of their lives, we tend to find the lowest cost option that meets our minimum aspiration which is known as satisficing. 
I think part of the solution is to have benevolent climate leadership that integrates well designed �nudges� that make people take right actions towards environment protection - nudges are subtle, non-coercive ways to influence people's choices by guiding them toward a more beneficial outcome without restricting their freedom.

For developing regions�especially Africa�this gap is even more critical. Although African countries contribute the least to global emissions, they face the most severe impacts of climate change, such as water scarcity, extreme weather, and climate-related insecurity. Yet the continent receives only a small fraction of global climate finance, leaving adaptation needs largely unmet and resilience efforts underfunded.

Another major challenge is the lack of meaningful inclusivity. Youth, women, Indigenous groups, and frontline communities are often consulted symbolically but excluded from real decision-making spaces.

This creates a widening divide between where climate solutions exist and where they are most urgently needed.

At the center of this challenge is financial instability. Farmers, small producers, and low-income households often operate with thin margins, making it difficult to invest in sustainable practices even when they know they are beneficial. Without predictable income or financial protection, climate-smart options like solar-powered irrigation, efficient storage, regenerative farming, and clean processing equipment feel out of reach.

This is why I believe enabling environments through inclusive financing, fair markets, and risk-mitigation tools are essential for meaningful climate action.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is designing policies that are both effective and equitable, especially with a growing global population. As population increases, so does the demand for resources, energy, and land, which intensifies environmental degradation and climate change. Creating policies that address the needs of all communities�particularly vulnerable, low-income, or marginalized groups�is complex but crucial.

Climate solutions must prioritize equity, ensuring that those who contribute least to emissions, but suffer the most from climate impacts, are supported in their adaptation and resilience efforts. This means not only focusing on emissions reductions but also on providing resources and opportunities for the most affected populations.

The challenge is to ensure that all regions, industries, and communities�regardless of their economic status�have the tools and support needed for a just transition to a low-carbon future. Achieving this balance of urgency with fairness is key to fostering a sustainable world where no one is left behind.

In essence, climate action must be inclusive, ensuring that equity is at the heart of global solutions and that we build a future that benefits everyone.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between commitments and implementation. While many governments and institutions have made ambitious pledges, the translation of these commitments into concrete, community-centered action remains slow and uneven. This gap is driven by limited financing, weak accountability mechanisms, and the exclusion of young people and vulnerable communities from decision-making processes.

Communities most affected by climate impacts such as rural populations, women, and youth often lack the resources, information, and platforms needed to influence policy. As a result, climate solutions are frequently designed without local context, leading to low adoption and limited long-term impact. Additionally, misinformation and low public awareness hinder efforts to build a united, informed climate movement.

Another major challenge is the lack of investment in climate education and capacity building. Without equipping young people with the skills to innovate, advocate, and lead, climate action risks becoming surface-level rather than transformative.

Another major challenge is limited access to finance for adaptation. Smallholder farmers, who are among the most affected, struggle to invest in climate-smart technologies such as efficient irrigation, drought-tolerant crops, or renewable energy. Without financial support, these communities remain vulnerable to unpredictable weather patterns.

Additionally, climate information does not always reach the people who need it most. Farmers may not receive timely forecasts, training, or guidance on how to adapt. This slows down local action even when the willingness is there.

272,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and practical implementation. Many people, organizations, and governments understand that climate change is a serious threat, but translating that awareness into consistent, large-scale action remains difficult.

One major issue is limited resources, especially in developing countries like Malawi, where communities face more immediate challenges such as unemployment, poverty, and inadequate infrastructure. This means climate issues often feel secondary, even though they directly affect livelihoods. Without sufficient funding, technology, or government support, climate solutions remain slow to implement.

Another challenge is lack of coordination. Climate action requires collaboration among governments, private sector, communities, and youth groups. However, efforts are often fragmented, short-term, or driven by donor priorities rather than long-term local needs.

Additionally, climate misinformation and low levels of environmental education make it harder for communities to adopt sustainable practices. Many people still don�t fully understand the connection between day-to-day behaviors�such as burning waste or cutting trees�and the long-term impact on weather patterns, health, and food security.

Finally, climate change is accelerating faster than policies can respond. Extreme weather, rising temperatures, and environmental degradation are worsening every year, making it more urgent to act.

Many countries, especially in the Global South, face severe climate impacts but lack the financing, technology, and capacity to implement solutions effectively. Climate funds are often slow, difficult to access, or do not reach the communities most affected.
Another challenge is poor coordination. Governments, NGOs, and international partners frequently work in parallel, creating duplication instead of scalable, integrated solutions. Many climate strategies are also designed far from local realities, without including community knowledge or youth perspectives.

Uganda faces frequent climate shocks�droughts, floods, and landslides�but the funds available for climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, renewable energy expansion, and community adaptation remain far below the country�s needs. As a result, many climate initiatives are small-scale, donor-dependent, or slow to implement.

This financial constraint also affects other key areas of climate action. Local governments struggle to enforce environmental laws, leading to continued deforestation, wetland encroachment, and degradation of natural resources. Farmers often lack access to climate-smart technologies and reliable information, making rural communities more vulnerable to weather variability. Additionally, the heavy dependence on biomass fuels and rapid population growth further strain land and energy resources.

Many people understand that climate change is real, but translating this knowledge into practical action�especially at the community level�remains difficult. Factors such as limited funding, inadequate infrastructure, and weak enforcement of environmental policies make it hard for individuals and communities to adopt sustainable practices.

Another challenge is that climate solutions often overlook local realities. Many climate policies are designed at national or international levels, but they do not always reflect the daily struggles of ordinary people who are dealing with unemployment, poverty, and limited access to basic services. For communities facing immediate economic pressures, climate action can feel like a luxury instead of a necessity. This makes behavior change slow and sometimes unrealistic without strong support systems.

Misinformation and low climate literacy also contribute to the problem. In many places, people do not fully understand the long-term risks of environmental degradation or the benefits of sustainable practices. This creates resistance to change and hinders participation in climate programs.

This is to say, many youth are only allowed to seat at a table to fulfill the aspect of participating while in reality they are not included in decision making. If actions are to be youth centred, there is a need to engage them from the onset of the strategic plans to its adoption. Sadly, youth representations are very low in such high levels of decision making, making it hard for them to lead climate actions in their communities. Only tokenism works, otherwise no inclusion and engagement in most government, councils and departments. 


This is accompanied by a major gab between the global climate commitments and real actions on the ground.For years, many leaders and countries have made great promises towards climate actions, however, there is little to no support to the implementations for such promises.  A good example, is that there is no commitment in removing the usage of cars that produces more gas to the air. This is evident through the numbers of cars people are importing in the country. These cars are not electric ones which means the pollution of the gas will continue.These drawbacks in return have impacted the communities to not cope with climate impacts that are already existing.",0.60579085,0.51686865,0.4224658,0.6761341737863966,#f7e379

At the same time, geopolitical crises and economic instability have diverted attention and resources away from climate goals, slowing progress on renewable energy transitions and resilience building Global Center on Adaptation.

Another critical challenge is climate finance. Developing countries, which are often most vulnerable to climate impacts, struggle to access sufficient funding for adaptation and green growth. Without equitable financing, the global response risks deepening inequalities and leaving front line communities behind.

While international agreements and high-level commitments are crucial, they often fail to translate into tangible benefits at the grassroots level, especially in vulnerable Global South communities.

This gap creates a dual problem. First, a ""trust deficit"" where local populations, who bear the brunt of climate impacts, see global frameworks as distant and irrelevant, leading to disengagement. Second, a massive efficiency loss, as top-down solutions frequently ignore local knowledge, cultural contexts, and immediate socio-economic needs like job security.

From my work in Upper Egypt, I've seen that communities are more likely to embrace climate solutions when they are framed around co-benefits like economic opportunity, health, and stability�the core of human security.

These storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, while recovery takes five to seven years at best. It�s an impossible cycle to sustain.

Beyond the physical damage, the deeper issue is how to make global systems, especially corporations and major emitters, see beyond short-term profit and act for the collective good. Climate action cannot succeed if it continues to overlook the most vulnerable nations, or if economic growth remains disconnected from planetary wellbeing.

Another major barrier is the disconnect between global policies and local realities. Communities most affected by climate change�especially in the Global South�often lack the tools, information, and resources to protect themselves, even though they contribute the least to the problem. This creates a cycle where vulnerability grows faster than solutions.

Misinformation is also a growing challenge. It weakens public understanding, slows down support for climate policies, and makes it harder for youth and communities to engage effectively.

Finally, climate action requires cross-sector cooperation�governments, businesses, and civil society working together. Today, these groups often act in silos, which slows progress.

In places like Botswana and Malawi, climate impacts such as droughts, heatwaves, waste pollution, and water scarcity are already visible. But many communities still do not have access to clear information on why these changes are happening or what they can do to adapt. This creates a gap between national climate plans (such as NDCs and NAPs) and what ordinary people know or practice on the ground.

Young people also struggle because climate information is often presented in technical language, making it harder for them to engage with policy processes. This limits youth participation in decision-making spaces.

Because of this lack of awareness, climate action remains slow, and communities are left unprepared for rising risks.

To address this, we need simple climate education, youth-friendly information, and community programmes that explain climate change in ways people can easily understand. When communities are informed, they become active partners in climate solutions, not just observers.

Climate change is also about justice, women�s unpaid labor, youth�s excluded voices, and Indigenous stewardship remain undervalued, even though they hold keys to sustainable solutions. Without equity, climate action risks becoming extractive instead of transformative.

Real progress will come when climate action is rooted in dignity, storytelling, and systems change. We must move beyond symbolic gestures and ensure those most impacted are co-designers of solutions.

Many people understand that the climate is changing, yet they do not feel personally involved in finding solutions. This has slowed progress in many countries, including Zambia. We face unreliable rainfall, falling water levels in Lake Kariba, long hours of load shedding, and reduced crop yields, yet daily habits have not shifted enough to match the scale or speed of the problem.

Climate action often feels distant from everyday life. Farmers experiencing drought may see it as a routine hardship rather than part of a growing environmental crisis. In towns, waste management is a struggle because communities lack both facilities and motivation to reduce or recycle waste. Simple actions like planting trees or protecting streams are often ignored because the benefits feel too far away.

Limited resources in schools worsen this. Young people learn about climate issues in short fragments rather than through hands-on activities that build understanding and responsibility, slowing the growth of a climate-conscious generation.

The greatest challenge lies in fostering a shared belief that climate action is everyone�s duty. Real progress begins when individuals, communities, and institutions recognise their role and understand that even small choices have real power to shape a safer future.

Another critical challenge is climate inequality. Countries like Malawi face extreme weather events, food insecurity, and loss of livelihoods, yet they receive a very small share of climate finance. This makes it difficult to adapt, invest in resilient systems, or implement local solutions that communities urgently need.

A third challenge is low youth inclusion in decision-making. Young people are leading activism and innovation, but they are rarely given meaningful space in policy processes, budgeting, or climate negotiations.

Many countries, especially the most climate-vulnerable, are strengthening their NDCs and outlining pathways for resilience and low-emission development, yet the resources, governance structures, and market mechanisms required to implement these plans remain limited or inaccessible. This gap is driven by a global financial architecture misaligned with climate priorities. Developing nations face high borrowing costs, limited risk-sharing tools, and fragmented carbon market governance, all of which constrain their ability to mobilize capital for impactful climate projects. Weak institutional capacities to track, verify, and manage emissions further erode trust and impede high-integrity outcomes.

Progress on operationalizing cooperation frameworks like Article 6 is also slow. Although these mechanisms could unlock significant climate finance, they require clear rules, strong safeguards, and robust monitoring systems to function effectively.
Climate action frequently overlooks local communities,the people most affected by climate change. When investments fail to incorporate community priorities and indigenous knowledge, long-term resilience becomes difficult to achieve.

306,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. While climate change is widely recognised as a global crisis, many governments, institutions, and individuals still lack the political will, resources, or urgency to act decisively. This inaction is often driven by competing priorities, short-term economic interests, and limited understanding of the long-term impacts of climate inaction.

Additionally, lack of climate education and grassroots engagement makes it difficult to mobilise local communities, especially in vulnerable regions. Many people still see climate change as a distant or abstract issue (exactly how I viewed it before ?????), rather than a direct threat to their livelihoods and health.

Inequity is another major challenge. In developing countries, such as Malawi, despite contributing the least to global emissions, often bear the greatest burden of climate impacts. Yet, they face challenges in accessing climate finance, technology, and support needed for adaptation and mitigation.

Finally, misinformation and political polarization continue to slow progress by undermining public trust in science and delaying urgent policy decisions.

Another critical challenge is inequality in climate responsibility and impact. Communities in the Global South, like my own in the Central African Republic, face some of the harshest effects of climate change floods, droughts, and food insecurity yet contribute very little to global emissions. This imbalance makes it harder for affected communities to access the support, technology, and resources they need, while wealthier nations sometimes struggle to meet their commitments.

This challenge manifests in ways such as:
Underfunding of Adaptation: Mitigation efforts often attract private capital, while crucial adaptation projects are consistently underfunded, despite being an existential priority for vulnerable communities.
Debt and Conditionality: Climate funding often arrives as high-interest loans, deepening the debt crisis and constraining national budgets that should be dedicated to resilience-building.
Policy Disconnect: There is a significant disconnect between ambitious global pledges (like the Paris Agreement goals) and the on-the-ground reality of local implementation, especially concerning the transparency and speed of financial flows.

While climate change is widely discussed, many individuals especially youth and communities in the Global South lack access to the tools, knowledge, and enabling environments that allow them to act meaningfully. Climate literacy remains fragmented, often limited to technical or environmental terms rather than empowering people to connect climate impacts to their rights, livelihoods, and local realities.

This disconnect creates a barrier between global policies and local implementation. Communities understand the urgency but struggle to translate that understanding into collective action because of limited resources, institutional support, and inclusive participation in decision-making.

To bridge this gap, we must invest in transformational climate literacy approaches that combine education, advocacy, and practice, linking scientific understanding with social justice and political influence. My work with ActionAid has shown that when youth gain both the knowledge and confidence to lead, they can drive powerful local solutions from renewable energy cooperatives to feminist climate campaigns.

In Malawi, people are not ignorant of the crisis they watch floodwaters wash away homes in Nsanje, see their crops burn in the sun in Balaka, and bury loved ones after landslides in Chiradzulu. They feel climate change in their hunger, in their loss, and in their fear of the next rainy season.

But when poverty is the daily reality, environmental choices become survival choices. Families cut down trees for charcoal not out of neglect, but because there are no affordable alternatives. Farmers continue to plant maize in depleted soils because policies do not reach the last mile with drought-resistant seeds, irrigation support, or fair markets. Young people rise with ideas yet lack the funding and platform to be taken seriously in national planning.

Climate action fails when policies stay on paper when the people most affected are not included in crafting the solutions.

340,"After six years working on climate action in Tanzania, I believe the biggest challenge isn�t the amount of climate finance promised, but the broken system that decides where the money goes. This financial failure reflects a deeper crisis: the disconnect between high-level policy and frontline realities.
The Core Problem: Finance That Never Arrives
Funds rarely reach the farmers, fishers, and coastal families in my region, confronting rising seas and erratic rainfall. Money remains stuck in bureaucracies while local needs grow. This has bred resistance from communities; without trust and resources at the grassroots, climate commitments become empty declarations.
As a journalist working on climate change, I often imagine what our fishers, farmers, and Tanzania�s local climate leaders could achieve if they were prioritized and directly supported. Streamlined funding could turn their everyday resilience into a real movement, one strong enough to push climate action from the bottom up and make our country stronger.

341,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is not ambition or technology; it is the gap between responsibility and inclusion. Policies increasingly recognise urgency, yet they rarely incorporate the realities of those most affected. Decisions are often made far from communities living through heatwaves, water stress, displacement, and resource conflict, creating a mismatch between political priorities and lived experience.

In the Global South, this disconnect is amplified by structural inequality, limited adaptive capacity, and uneven access to finance. Even well-intentioned climate measures can reproduce exclusions when gender, identity, and local governance are treated as add-ons rather than core determinants of resilience. Economic and institutional constraints concentrate responsibility, leaving communities with little agency to adapt or influence outcomes. 

The solution lies in distributed approaches, sharing responsibility, building local capacities, and designing governance that actively empowers communities. Climate action should go beyond procedural plans, hearings, and consultations to create mechanisms where resources, decision-making, and accountability are genuinely shared. Bridging this gap requires climate policies that integrate intersectional realities, amplify community knowledge, and ensure local ownership of adaptation measures. Only then can climate action be effective, just, and enduring, turning ambition into tangible impact where it matters most.",0.4796784,0.54942846,0.89027905,0.7013232224351895,#f3a134

As a result, people continue to face droughts, heat stress, disease outbreaks, and livelihood losses without the support or tools they need to adapt effectively.

Another challenge is limited awareness and understanding of climate change at the community level. Many rely on traditional knowledge and may not fully recognize how environmental changes affect their lives, making it harder to adopt climate-smart practices. Without proper education and engagement, even the best solutions remain underused.

Access to funding and resources is also a major barrier. Youth-led and community-based climate projects often struggle to secure support, making it difficult to scale solutions that work.

Finally, slow implementation and low political prioritization hinder progress, with policies taking time to translate into real action.

Without affordable financing, many vulnerable populations cannot transition to sustainable systems or protect themselves from rising risks.

Another barrier is the slow adoption of technology and research driven solutions. Even when effective innovations exist, they are not always scaled due to weak collaboration between scientists, policymakers, industry players, and local communities. This slows progress and prevents climate strategies from becoming truly global.

A crucial dimension of this gap is the systemic exclusion of psychosocial resilience.

A Disaster Management Plan is fundamentally deficient if it secures physical assets but fails to fortify a community's mental health preparedness. For indigenous populations, climate change is an identity crisis that erodes established cultural fabrics. Furthermore, the ""Digital Divide"" compromises sophisticated digital early warning systems when the user experience is not centred on the common man, thus failing the most at-risk demographics.

The worldwide transition to renewable sources is the focus of meeting both the climate targets of the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. However, in the Global South, such a shift is characterized by the two-fold challenge of curbing climate change and confronting the old developmental issues of energy poverty, inequality, and economic dependency. The priorities of these issues require context-sensitive, empirically-based, and pro-social policy insights. Quantitative-only policies like carbon cutting or GDP expansion forecast policies fail to recognize the actual social facts, such as the displacement of communities, local job creation, or access to energy services by genders. Purely qualitative knowledge might not be as empirical as needed in the planning of national energy or the negotiations of climate finance.

Communities that contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions�particularly in Africa and other parts of the Global South�are often the most exposed to climate shocks such as droughts, floods, and food insecurity. Without adequate access to climate finance, technology, and knowledge, these communities are forced into short-term survival strategies that can undermine long-term sustainability.

Another critical barrier is the lack of genuine inclusion of local voices in climate governance. Policies are frequently designed in top-down ways that overlook indigenous knowledge, youth leadership, and community-driven solutions. This leads to low trust, weak ownership, and limited long-term impact.

372,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is policy disintegration, especially in many parts of the Global South. Climate commitments are often ambitious on paper, but national strategies, sectoral regulations, and implementation plans do not always align. This disconnect creates uncertainty, slows investment, and weakens the ability of governments to implement long-term, coherent climate action.

From my experience supporting Indonesia�s Low Carbon Development Initiative (LCDI), I see how difficult it can be to integrate policies across ministries. Modelling may show a clear pathway toward decarbonisation, but translating that evidence into coordinated policies, across energy, forestry, industry, transport, and provincial governments, remains a major challenge. Without alignment, even strong technical analysis cannot produce real change.

Another critical barrier is access to climate finance, particularly for countries that need investment most. There are growing opportunities but they often come with complex requirements or limited transparency. Many Global South countries struggle to mobilise financing at the scale needed because policies, data systems, and governance structures are not yet fully aligned to attract and absorb climate investment.

These challenges are interconnected: without coherent policy frameworks, finance is harder to access; and without finance, policy integration is harder to implement.",0.8428037,0.46190506,0.72021925,0.7493156568718825,#f3a134

The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between lived realities and meaningful policy response.
In many communities I�ve documented, climate change is already a daily experience; saltwater entering farmland, forests disappearing, soil losing strength, and people adapting in ways they never expected. But these realities often move faster than the systems meant to respond to them. Policies take time, resources are limited, and the people most affected have the least voice in the decisions being made.

Another challenge is awareness. Many people lack orientation about how their actions affect the climate and environment. Some do not believe in climate change, or feel disconnected from global conversations. This slows participation and makes it harder to build resilience. Through my work, I aim to educate and raise awareness by showing the human and environmental realities of climate change.

Climate action also often focuses on global solutions without fully understanding local contexts. Without this understanding, even well-designed solutions can miss the mark. For me, the biggest challenge is bridging these gaps, ensuring that local realities guide policy, and that communities facing climate impacts are included, understood, and supported. Action must be both global and local to succeed. ",0.37475038,0.42799824,0.50273323,0.747433945869131,#f3a134

While there is an unprecedented amount of climate data available, from satellite imagery to community-level surveys, translating this information into actionable, context-specific policies remains a major hurdle. 

Too often, data is collected at the global or national level, but fails to inform the real needs and priorities of local communities who are on the frontlines of climate impacts.
This disconnect is further compounded by the limited flow of adaptation finance to grassroots initiatives. Many funding mechanisms are designed with complex requirements that local organizations struggle to meet, resulting in resources being concentrated at higher administrative levels or in large-scale projects that may overlook local realities. As a result, innovative, community-driven solutions, such as those led by women, youth, and indigenous groups are often underfunded and underutilized.

To overcome this challenge, it is essential to invest in systems that make climate data accessible and relevant for local decision-makers, and to design financial instruments that are flexible, inclusive, and responsive to community needs.

Without that accessible, stable funding, grassroots groups like the Nabweru North Youth Association can't scale up our successful local work into sustainable regional models.
It's also completely unbalanced. Most of the money that does show up heavily favors huge mitigation projects in already-developed places. Meanwhile, those of us on the front lines, dealing with the actual droughts and floods, struggle to get financing just for basic adaptation and resilience. Plus, the complex paperwork and bureaucracy make it impossible for local leaders to even access the capital they need.

Vulnerable groups, especially people with disabilities, women, and rural communities, are often excluded from planning and decision-making, resulting in resilience initiatives that overlook their unique risks, as seen during Cyclone Freddy. Climate information services also remain underdeveloped, reducing the effectiveness of early warning systems.

Globally, inadequate climate finance and delays in fulfilling adaptation and loss-and-damage pledges restrict countries like Malawi from investing in long-term resilience, technology, and infrastructure.

Without decisive action to reduce emissions, adaptation efforts alone will never be sufficient. One clear example is the continued reliance on charcoal as a primary energy source. Millions of households in Malawi depend on charcoal for cooking and heating due to limited access to electricity, gas, or other clean energy alternatives. Charcoal production drives deforestation, reducing the land�s natural capacity to sequester carbon and exacerbating soil degradation. The demand is maintained because charcoal is affordable and culturally familiar, while producers rely on it for their livelihoods.

Climate inequity is another major challenge, as those who contribute least to emissions such as vulnerable communities, women, and youth often face the harshest consequences, including droughts, floods, and displacement. Insufficient awareness, misinformation, and limited political will further hinder adoption of sustainable practices and climate investments.
Addressing these challenges requires equitable solutions that combine financing, education, and community engagement.

Although climate change is widely is a national priority with the rise of droughts, floods, declining rainfall and loadshedding. Awareness into coordinated action remains difficult.

A major issue the impact of climate change on livlihoods for rural communities that depend on agriculture in Zambia are the prolonged droughts linked to El Nino. It led to crop failures, food insecurity and ecoonomic strains on the local people. A  number small-scale farmers still lack access to climate smart farming techniques, reliable weather information and resilient seed varieties. 

Another challenge in Zambia is energy insecurity. Zambia mainly depends on hydropower meaning climate induced low water levels directly affect electricity supply. Load shedding affects households, hospitals, schools and businesses making climate resilience not just an environmental issue but a development and economic one. Transitioning to renewable alternaltives such as solar enerfy requires greather investment and policy consistency.

While global agreements such as the Paris Accord and successive COPs have set ambitious targets, many countries, especially in the Global South, struggle to translate these pledges into concrete action due to limited resources and institutional capacity.  

Climate finance remains unpredictable, insufficient, and often inaccessible or poorly adapted to the needs of the communities most affected by climate change. This creates an implementation gap: strategies exist on paper, but without adequate financing, adaptation projects, renewable energy transitions, and biodiversity conservation initiatives cannot scale to meet the urgency of the crisis.

Communities who live closest to the land and feel the impacts first still lack access to the resources, tools, and financing needed to adapt.

Another challenge is that climate action often forgets the human side. Farmers are not just beneficiaries they are partners, innovators, and protectors of our ecosystems. But without training, market access, or climate information, they cannot fully participate in the transition to resilience. This creates a cycle where those most affected contribute the least to decision making.

There is also a lack of coordination. Many organizations work separately, leading to short-term projects instead of long-term systems change. Meanwhile, young leaders especially in Africa are struggling to access opportunities to develop climate solutions despite having the passion and ideas to drive real change.

In many countries, especially in the Global South, climate action is further hampered by weak coordination between the national and provincial/county governments, insufficient citizen participation and inadequate safeguards against capture by politicians and elites of climate projects. When communities are excluded from planning and oversight, interventions often fail to respond to the real needs of the community.
Additionally, climate change often interacts with conflict dynamics. In the absence of strong governance frameworks, climate interventions can intentionally heighten tensions instead of promoting harmony.
To solve these challenges, climate actions must be accompanied by transparent climate finance, community driven decision making and  stronger accountability mechanisms.

433,"
One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation. Many people understand that climate change is a problem, but translating that awareness into consistent action�at government, private sector, and community levels�remains difficult.
A major part of this gap comes from limited resources, weak policies, and inadequate investment in sustainable infrastructure. Many communities still lack access to renewable energy, proper waste systems, climate-smart agriculture, or early-warning systems. Even when solutions exist, they are often not scaled up due to funding barriers or lack of political will.
Another challenge is misinformation and low climate literacy. People underestimate the urgency of the crisis or see climate action as something �far away,� even though its impacts�heatwaves, flooding, rising prices, health risks�are already affecting daily life.

At the same time, vulnerable groups, particularly women and low-income communities, are often excluded from planning and decision-making, leaving climate policies disconnected from ground realities.

Another critical barrier is the siloed nature of climate strategies: climate, biodiversity, and livelihood programmes are often designed separately, despite being deeply interconnected. This limits the effectiveness of climate action and slows resilience building.

Access to fair climate finance, technology transfer, and inclusive governance remains unequal. Without addressing these systemic gaps, the global climate agenda will struggle to achieve real, lasting progress.",0.80968785,0.46905577,0.8029077,0.8127780628254129,#f3a134

We have the data, the frameworks, and the financial instruments, but we consistently fail to bridge the gap between global strategy and local survival.
In my work across African financial markets, I see this daily. A farmer in Northern Ghana doesn't experience ""climate risk"" as a statistical probability; she experiences it as the failed rainy season that collapses her livelihood and voids the loan she received based on historical weather patterns. A bank in Luanda views a ""green investment"" not through the lens of TNFD, but through the immediate risk to its portfolio from a client's flooded infrastructure.
Our current approach often tries to retrofit global solutions onto local problems, creating a friction that slows progress to a crawl. The real work the hard work is not in creating another financial product, but in designing it with the end-user, embedding their lived reality into its DNA. It's about translating climate science into the language of a loan officer's dashboard and a farmer's almanac.
Until we close this Empathy Gap by co-creating solutions that speak directly to the fears, aspirations, and economic realities of those on the frontlines, we will continue to deploy capital and strategy with sub-optimal impact. ",0.47810674,0.6696527,0.65380037,0.641541068940955,#f7e379

Such disproportionate effects include but are not limited to prolonged dry spells and floods in countries such as Malawi, leading to poor harvests and extreme food shortage cases. However, other countries are not experiencing such extreme direct effects. Leading to poor commitment in allocating the needed resources and measures to collaboratively address climate change with all the urgency that it deserves. 

Similarly, climate change is being perceived by the public and elected officials across different countries as a distant threat not necessitating immediate measures. There is also a diffusion of responsibility across the globe since the causes of climate change are global in nature even though the effects are felt differently or disproportionate across countries. Leading to poor accountability. This is made complex by the differences in the levels of contribution to greenhouse gas emissions across countries and regions of the globe.

Second, unequal access to resources makes it harder for communities especially those most affected by climate change to participate in or benefit from climate solutions. Without equitable financing, technology transfer, and support, global progress remains uneven.

Third, misinformation and polarization make it difficult to build broad public consensus. Clear scientific evidence competes with conflicting narratives that can delay policy adoption and weaken collective action.

Finally, transitioning to a low-carbon world requires major systemic changes in energy, transportation, food systems, and consumption habits. These shifts demand coordination across sectors, which is challenging at the scale and speed required.

Minority and displaced communities are hit first and hardest, but they are usually last in line for support and almost never at the table when decisions are made.

At global level, climate finance is slow, complex and often prefers stable countries and big projects over fragile places and small community initiatives.

This gap is especially clear at the intersection of climate and public health. As climate change drives the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria, health systems in low-resource settings remain underprepared. Early detection tools, environmental monitoring technologies, and adaptive public-health planning exist, but they are not reaching the frontline quickly enough.

Another major challenge is fragmentation. Climate research, policy, technology, and community action often operate in silos. Solutions are created without understanding local contexts, and local innovations rarely scale or influence broader policy.

Nations have set ambitious emission reduction targets (such as the $1.5�C target in the Paris Agreement), but implementation is stalling, particularly in the following areas: 
Financing (especially in the Global South): There is a huge financing gap for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, including the DRC. Promises of $100 billion per year made by developed countries are not being kept, and access to funds is often too complex. 
Energy System Inertia: The world remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, fuelling the inertia of global economic systems. The rapid transition to sustainable alternatives is hampered by vested interests and a lack of massive investment in renewable energy and related infrastructure. 
Meeting this challenge requires accelerating financial commitment, simplifying access to funds for local actors, and ending fossil fuel subsidies.

468,"
One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation. Many people understand that climate change is a global threat, but translating this awareness into consistent, practical action�at government, community, and individual levels�remains difficult.

A major part of this challenge comes from limited resources and unequal capacities, especially in developing countries where communities face the worst impacts of climate change but have the least financial and technical support to adapt. Even when solutions exist�such as reforestation, renewable energy, or better waste management�lack of funding, training, and infrastructure slows down progress.

Another key challenge is coordination. Climate action requires collaboration across sectors, generations, and nations. Yet policies, responsibilities, and priorities are often fragmented, making long-term planning difficult. This weakens the effectiveness of environmental initiatives and slows down innovation.

Finally, climate action struggles with short-term thinking. Many institutions prioritize immediate economic gains over long-term sustainability, which prevents the adoption of bold climate solutions.

Overall, the biggest challenge is not the absence of solutions, but the difficulty of bringing people, resources, and political will together in a sustained and coordinated way. Overcoming this gap is essential to building a resilient and sustainable future.",0.6068988,0.101899445,0.37743223,0.8604728342705403,#e51f1f
469,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the interplay between population growth, economic inequality, and environmental degradation. A rapidly increasing population, particularly in developing nations, creates a pressure that compels communities to rely on environmentally damaging practices for immediate survival. In Malawi, for example, the need for land and fuel leads to deforestation, while industrialization to meet a growing population's needs adds to pollution. This challenge is compounded by economic disparities, which mean many developing countries lack the resources and technology to adopt cleaner, more sustainable practices. Ultimately, achieving meaningful climate action requires addressing not only environmental impacts but also the systemic socioeconomic factors that leave vulnerable populations with few sustainable options.

While countries successfully negotiate ambitious targets (like the 1.5�C goal and biodiversity frameworks) at COPs and UN Forums, the subsequent failure lies in translating these international NDCs and NAPs into financially viable, on the ground projects that directly benefit vulnerable communities and ecosystems. This gap is exacerbated by two factors: first, a critical shortage of concessional (grant-based) adaptation finance reaching the developing world, forcing nations to take on debt to prepare for impacts they didn't cause; and second, the institutional inertia and political resistance often from vested interests in fossil fuels or unsustainable agriculture that prevent the adoption of innovative economic tools, like true pricing or carbon taxes, necessary to fund the transition at scale. Until we master innovative, debt-free financing and enhance institutional capacity to channel funds from policy to the projects that need it, global climate targets will remain largely aspirational.",0.878814,0.48421282,0.72863257,0.8338451398291221,#f3a134
471,"The biggest challenge to the climate today is human-driven greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming and extreme weather. Industrialization, deforestation, reliance on fossil fuels, and unsustainable agriculture have increased carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures, melting glaciers, sea-level rise, and floods or droughts. These changes threaten ecosystems, human health, food security, and economic stability.

A key factor worsening this challenge is the lack of widespread sustainable practices. Many people and countries still prioritize short-term economic gains, while urbanization, overconsumption, and poor waste management reduce nature�s ability to absorb carbon. Limited awareness and climate education also prevent many from understanding their role in addressing climate change.

Global cooperation is another critical hurdle. Climate change requires coordinated action, but political and economic differences, along with delayed commitments from high-emission industries, slow progress toward international targets like the Paris Agreement.

In conclusion, the main challenge is the combination of high emissions, unsustainable practices, and insufficient collaboration. Addressing this requires education, innovation, policy enforcement, and a global commitment to sustainable development.

While ambition continues to rise, communities facing the harshest climate impacts still lack access to timely, predictable, and accessible climate finance. This slows adaptation, increases vulnerability, and leaves countries unable to address loss and damage effectively.

A second challenge is the equity gap in global climate governance. Those who contribute least to the crisis particularly African and small island communities remain underrepresented in decision making and face structural barriers to technology, data, and funding. Without fairness and inclusion, climate action risks reinforcing global inequalities rather than reducing them.

A third challenge is weak coordination across institutions and sectors. Climate change is cross-cutting, yet many responses remain siloed, duplicated, or poorly aligned with local realities. This limits the scale and speed of implementation.

This creates a cycle where vulnerable populations face worsening impacts while global policies fail to prioritize their realities. 
Another challenge is the disconnect between grassroots action and global governance. Youth movements, indigenous knowledge, and local innovations are powerful drivers of resilience, yet they are rarely integrated into formal strategies. 
Without bridging the gap, climate action risks being top-down and ineffective.  
Finally, short-terms economic interests outweigh long-term sustainability, while fossil fuel dependence, unsustainable mining, weak enforcement, and insufficient financing stalling progress.

Countries that commit to rapid decarbonisation often face competitive disadvantages when fossil fuel producers continue expanding production. The challenge is greater for many Global South countries, as they are disproportionately affected by climate impacts, yet have fewer resources to decarbonise and historically contributed less to emissions.

Fossil fuel interests also complicate negotiations. The record numbers of lobbyists at recent COPs and slow progress on a global plastics treaty show how these interests can stall consensus. 

This lack of unity weakens the Paris Agreement�s ambition cycle. Since NDCs are non-binding, commitments risk being deprioritised in the face of economic or geopolitical pressures.

It slows progress even when solutions already exist.

Another part of the challenge is that climate action often feels distant from people�s immediate needs. Many communities worry about income, food, or housing long before they worry about rising temperatures. When climate work is presented without linking it to these basic needs, it fails to gain momentum. People support change when they can see how it improves their own wellbeing.

There is also a problem of scattered effort. Projects are launched every year, yet many are small, uncoordinated, or short lived. Without long term support and reliable data, even good ideas fade before they create lasting results.

To move forward, climate action must become practical, local, and tied to daily life. Communities should see the benefits in real time, not as distant promises.

First, information inequality leaves millions without timely or localized climate data. Extreme weather becomes deadly not only because it happens, but because people are unprepared or uninformed.
Second, structural exclusion means marginalized groups, youth, women, low-income communities, and informal residents rarely influence climate strategies, even though they face the greatest risks.
Finally, implementation gaps persist. Solutions often remain project-based, short-term, or disconnected from community behavior, making long-term resilience difficult.

For climate action to succeed, we must democratize access to climate information, empower local communities to participate, and build tools that translate awareness into action.

While ambitious policies and international agreements exist, many countries face structural limitations such as inadequate financing, weak institutional capacity, limited data systems, and socio-economic vulnerability. This creates a paradox where those most affected by climate change are also the least equipped to respond.

Another major challenge is the lack of meaningful integration of climate action with social and economic development strategies. In many countries, climate policies are designed separately from employment, education, gender equality, and economic resilience plans. This leads to solutions that are technically sound but socially unsustainable for example, green transitions that risk excluding young people, informal workers, or women entrepreneurs who lack access to skills, finance, or opportunities.

To overcome these challenges, climate action must be local, inclusive, and supported by stronger global solidarity particularly in financing and technology transfer. Evidence-based approaches, transparent governance, and youth leadership will be essential to bridge the gap between ambition and impact.",0.6773765,0.425273,0.9246435,0.8011886401238063,#f3a134
497,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between global awareness and meaningful, sustained implementation, especially in vulnerable regions like Africa. While many people understand that climate change is real and urgent, the systems, resources, and political commitments needed to address it effectively are often weak or inconsistent. This creates a major barrier to long-term progress.

A key part of this challenge is limited financing for climate projects, particularly for grassroots and community-led initiatives. Many developing countries face pressing economic and social needs, making it difficult to prioritize climate investments without external support. As a result, communities most affected by climate impacts, such as farmers, women, and young people,often lack the tools, technologies, and training required to adapt.

Another significant issue is the lack of climate education and awareness at the local level. Even when policies exist, many people do not fully understand sustainable practices, early warning systems, or how to protect their environment. This makes it harder to build community resilience.

Finally, weak collaboration among governments, civil society, and private sectors slows down progress. Climate action requires unified efforts, shared responsibility, and strong partnerships.

This denotes that the approach is modernistic rather than participatory approach. In effect, community ownership of the climate change and environmental issues is imperiled. Taking that into account, there is need for participatory projects for sustainability. Chavinda (2022) also points a crucial aspect that most climate change action have sidelined such as the role of culture and knowledge of local people when he analysed how science-driven discourse is integrated to communicate climate change science. Overall, I opine that media if well positioned can significantly contribute to the smooth climate action given that media produce cultural products sensitive to the culture in which it operates.

500,"I think the biggest hurdle in tackling climate change today is balancing human development with environmental responsibility. We need to advance society while minimizing the negative impacts of our actions on the climate. Industrial growth drives rising demand for energy, technology, and consumer goods, yet these same activities often produce emissions and environmental damage faster than mitigation efforts can keep up.

High levels of CFCs and other greenhouse gases are released during industrial processes, and electronics and high-tech products emit harmful gases at a pace that surpasses mitigation strategies. This shows a systemic issue: technological and economic growth often conflicts with sustainability goals, making it hard to separate progress from environmental harm.

Another challenge is the opportunity cost of investing in climate action. Resources for mitigation or adaptation compete with immediate economic, social, or developmental priorities, especially in emerging economies. Convincing governments, industries, and communities to prioritize long-term climate resilience over short-term gains is difficult.

Ultimately, the challenge is not only technological but societal. We need solutions that enable human progress without worsening climate damage. Achieving this balance requires innovation, policy, and global cooperation that integrate sustainability into all aspects of development�so advancing society and protecting the planet are achievable together.

502,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action right now is the gap between good climate plans and actual on-the-ground action. Many countries, organizations, and leaders agree on climate goals, but struggle to carry them out in real life.

One major problem is a lack of money and resources. Activities like planting trees, building renewable-energy systems, or helping communities adapt need serious funding. 

In poorer or developing countries, governments often have other urgent needs (like health care or schools), plus the issue of fighting for self-interests, and climate action may get less support.

From my perspective as a political scientist with an academic background in ""Political Science"", another big barrier is weak political will and policy support. Sometimes, leaders worry about short-term costs or are under pressure from industries that benefit from fossil fuels. This means climate policies may be delayed or never enforced.

Lastly, many people, like those in rural communities, have little information or awareness about climate change. Without understanding the problem or believing they can help, people may not take the small but important daily actions (like planting trees, using clean cooking, and conserving water).

Therefore, we know many solutions; however, what holds us back is a lack of resources, inapplicable policies, and limited awareness. Through strong leadership, fair funding, and community engagement, we can tackle the challenges.

While there is a wealth of research on climate change, renewable energy, and adaptation strategies, much of it never reaches the communities that face these risks daily. In many places, especially in the Global South, limited resources, weak infrastructure, and social and economic pressures make it hard for people to act on what they know.

From my work with the Global Nature and Environmental Partnership (GNEP) in Nigeria, I have seen communities eager to take action, including young people, farmers, and displaced families, but struggling to access the tools, guidance, or support they need. People want to protect their land, water, and livelihoods, yet the gap between policy, science, and daily reality often leaves them frustrated and powerless.

Bridging this gap is essential. It requires translating research into practical, culturally relevant solutions, supporting youth leadership, and ensuring communities have the knowledge and resources to make informed choices.

This disconnect weakens trust, fuels misinformation, and makes climate action feel like something happening �out there� rather than within people�s daily reality.

Another major obstacle is the way climate issues are often communicated. Technical language, political agendas, and competing narratives can overwhelm the public, creating confusion at a time when clarity is needed most. I see this often in my work: people care deeply about their environment, but they are navigating a digital world where false information spreads faster than facts. When citizens cannot easily understand or trust climate messages, meaningful action becomes harder to sustain.

Today, many countries across the globe are experiencing climate change impacts affecting their lives and sustainable development. Climate finance should be the engine that drives mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts, yet it remains difficult to access despite the high ambition countries have demonstrated in their NDC over the previous years.  
Today, most of this component remains unimplemented due to the limited finance provided and the reluctance of some developed countries to honor their commitment to support climate actions.
Current existing funding is not only inadequate but also often delivered mostly in the form of grants and concessional financing, which disrupts the socio-economic development of the countries rather than enabling climate-resilient growth. 
Recently, IPCC reports have highlighted the alarming rise of the global temperature and the urgent need to accelerate climate action. Addressing climate needs a significant scale-up and reform of climate finance mechanisms to ensure they are fair, accessible, and responsive to the needs of vulnerable communities.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between global commitments and real implementation, especially in countries that contribute the least but suffer the most. While policies, pledges, and declarations multiply, the resources, political will, and accountability mechanisms needed to turn them into concrete action remain weak.

For regions like the Sahel and Central Africa, where I come from, this gap is devastating. Africa contributes less than 4% of global emissions yet faces some of the world�s highest climate vulnerability�from floods and heatwaves to food insecurity and displacement. In Cameroon alone, climate-related shocks affect millions of people each year, amplifying poverty, conflict, and instability. But communities do not wait; they innovate with almost no support.

A second major challenge is the exclusion of frontline communities and young people from decision-making spaces. Youth represent the largest generation in Africa�s history, yet we are rarely included in national or global climate negotiations where long-term decisions are made. When those who experience the crisis firsthand cannot shape the solutions, climate policies risk being disconnected from reality.

Finally, the lack of climate finance accessibility remains a barrier. Funds exist, but they seldom reach grassroots actors, local innovators, or young climate leaders who drive real change on the ground.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation.While many people, governments, and organizations now recognize the dangers of climate change, the actual steps taken to reduce emissions and protect the environment are often slow, unequal, or insufficient.

A major issue is the ,lack of political will and enforcement, especially in developing countries where climate action is often seen as less urgent compared to poverty, unemployment, or security. Even when climate policies are created, they are not always fully funded or monitored.

Another big challenge is .climate injustice.the fact that the people who suffer the most from climate change (such as those in Africa or small island nations) are the least responsible for causing it. These communities often lack the resources or technology to adapt, while richer nations continue to pollute at higher rates.

There is also a growing issue of .misinformation and lack of education, especially among rural populations. Many people do not fully understand how their daily activities (like burning waste or cutting trees) affect the climate, and they need better awareness and support to change behaviors.

To solve this challenge, we need stronger leadership, youth involvement, international cooperation, and investment in education and green innovation. Climate action must be practical, fair, and urgent  not just a promise, but a real movement.

Major decisions, such as capitalizing the Loss and Damage Fund, are slowed by short electoral cycles, making the flow of capital toward adaptation uncertain and administratively burdensome.

This global inertia directly impacts Senegal, where we face unsustainable pressure.

530,"I believe one of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the lack of genuine political will. Too often, global climate negotiations, including COP processes, are shaped by political calculations rather than science. Decisions that should be guided by robust IPCC findings are filtered through short-term agendas, so many critical issues remain unresolved or are watered down.

This problem is deepened by the influence of powerful private interests, especially fossil fuel companies, on national decision makers. Leaders often enter negotiations constrained by the expectations of their political and economic backers, which means outcomes are designed to protect profits and power instead of people and the planet.

As long as political self-interest overrides scientific evidence and long-term sustainability, global climate frameworks will remain underused. Effective climate action requires governments to commit to evidence-based policies, put ecological integrity and human rights ahead of short-term gains, and ensure international agreements translate into concrete measures at national and local levels. Only by centering science, transparency, and accountability in policymaking can we meaningfully address the climate crisis and protect vulnerable communities and ecosystems worldwide.

While international policies set ambitious goals, many communities�especially in the Global South�lack the resources, technology, and knowledge to implement effective climate solutions. This gap is worsened by limited youth and community engagement, with decision-making often excluding those most affected by climate change.

Indigenous knowledge and local practices are frequently overlooked, and misinformation continues to slow urgent action. Without connecting policy to people�s daily realities, climate strategies risk being ineffective or unsustainable.

Overcoming this challenge requires bridging global policy with grassroots action, empowering communities with education, resources, and agency, and ensuring youth voices lead in designing solutions. By centering equity, inclusion, and community-driven innovation, climate action can become both effective and resilient�turning knowledge and advocacy into tangible change that protects both people and the planet.

Critical areas along our coastline such as West Point, 1st to JFK shorelines, and Popo Beach are experiencing rapid and destructive ocean erosion. These communities face increasing risk from rising sea levels and stronger storm surges, yet the government and local authorities lack the significant funding required to construct durable coastal defenses, restore natural buffers, and relocate highly vulnerable populations. Without adequate financing, interventions remain slow, fragmented, or reactive instead of preventive.
Another major challenge is the lack of sufficient education and awareness, particularly in highly vulnerable communities. Many residents, especially those who are illiterate or elderly, do not fully understand the causes and impacts of climate change or the practical steps they can take to protect themselves. This gap limits community participation in climate programs, slows behavior change, and often results in resistance to relocation or adaptation efforts.

They stack on each other, and the result is constant illness and stress, especially for children and women. Climate action often treats these issues as single problems, instead of recognizing their cumulative impact on health and wellbeing.

Another major challenge is the lack of strong, community-focused education and program development. Families need clear guidance on heat safety, clean water practices, child protection, and smoke reduction. Without accessible education, preventable health risks grow, and climate impacts become harder to manage.

Policy and advocacy also remain significant gaps. Local and global decisions rarely reflect the daily experiences of displaced families, refugees, or low-income communities. When those most affected are not included in climate conversations, policies fail to target the real risks people face.

The biggest challenge is building a climate response that connects these three areas. We need policies shaped by community experience, programs that reflect real conditions, and an understanding of how multiple climate pressures work together to harm health.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between commitments and implementation. While global awareness and policy frameworks have increased, actual progress on the ground remains slow and uneven. Many countries announce ambitious targets for carbon neutrality or renewable energy transitions, but these are often undermined by inadequate funding, political hesitation, and short-term economic priorities.  

Developing nations face the additional burden of balancing growth with sustainability. Without equitable financial and technological support from wealthier nations, climate adaptation remains out of reach for vulnerable regions. This imbalance not only delays collective progress but also deepens global inequality.  

Another major obstacle is the lack of coordination among governments, industries, and communities. Fragmented policies and inconsistent enforcement weaken long-term strategies. Public understanding and participation also remain limited in many areas, which hinders meaningful grassroots engagement.  

Addressing climate change requires consistent collaboration and transparent accountability. Governments must move beyond declarations to enforceable actions, supported by fair financing and local empowerment. Only by closing the gap between promises and practice can the world make climate action both effective and inclusive.

Many countries have strong policy frameworks, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), climate laws, adaptation plans, carbon market strategies, and national taxonomies, yet the systems needed to operationalize them are either underdeveloped or disconnected from the institutions responsible for implementation.

This gap is largely driven by limited technical capacity across sectors, governments, financial institutions, and communities, creating a mismatch between policy ambition and real-life execution. Policymakers may introduce climate frameworks without adequately trained implementers. Banks may support green finance rhetorically, while lacking the skills to evaluate climate risks or finance adaptation. Communities may face climate impacts daily, but are excluded from policy design, climate finance access, and technology adoption.

As a result, climate action becomes policy on paper, not practice on the ground. This undermines trust, slows progress, and widens inequality between developed and developing regions.

This creates a disconnect where policies exist, but the real-world impact is limited.
To overcome these challenges, climate action needs to be practical and inclusive.

During COP27 and COP29 for example, I observed that even when funding mechanisms exist, local actors often lack clear guidance on application procedures, monitoring requirements, and accountability measures. 

This implementation gap is compounded by limited awareness and capacity across all stakeholders. Policymakers may understand targets, but technical officers at subnational levels often do not, and communities directly affected by climate change frequently have minimal involvement in designing interventions. 

To address this, climate action must integrate three key dimensions: (i) clear, practical frameworks for translating global commitments into local projects; (ii) multi-level knowledge sharing to build capacity and ensure accountability; and (iii) inclusive communication strategies that engage governments, private sector, and communities in understanding both the risks and the operational pathways for mitigation and adaptation.

Another core challenge is the limited inclusion of youth in meaningful decision-making. Youth are leading innovations, research, and community solutions, but they still struggle to influence policy due to weak institutional mechanisms, restricted access to data, and lack of funding. The Youth Stocktake further emphasizes gaps in participation and transparency in global climate processes, showing how youth contributions remain undervalued despite their scale and impact.

This is especially true in the Global South, where good intentions often struggle to take hold. Take Uganda, for example. We've got strong policies in place�the National Climate Change Act, ambitious climate commitments, and increasingly detailed data showing exactly where we're vulnerable. We know landslides threaten communities in the Elgon region. We know drought devastates Karamoja. The problem isn't knowledge, but it's execution. We lack the financial systems and technical capacity to turn that knowledge into action. The funding mechanisms that exist are painfully slow and tangled in red tape. Backed interventions are slow and bureaucratic.

Furthermore, there is a ""Data Justice"" challenge. Accessing global climate finance (like the Loss and Damage Fund) requires rigorous, long-term historical data to prove climate attribution. Many developing nations lack the historical data infrastructure to meet these evidentiary standards, effectively locking them out of the funds they need most.

To solve this, we must treat climate data as a public good and integrate it directly into financial decision-making. The challenge is moving from ""pledges"" to ""projects,"" ensuring that when a GIS specialist identifies a dying wetland, the policy and funding mechanisms are agile enough to save it before it is gone.",0.68182015,0.54311997,0.79859316,0.7175361316138037,#f3a134

Across Africa and the Global South, climate finance rarely reaches communities experiencing displacement and disaster firsthand. Billions pledged at conferences fail to reach grassroots organizations. We desperately need simplified mechanisms funding community-led initiatives directly. Indigenous knowledge holders and local youth innovators understand context-specific solutions, they need resources, not just recognition. Effective adaptation requires integrating local ecological knowledge with modern technology. African communities have centuries of climate adaptation experience that frameworks often overlook.

Another critical challenge is inequity. Communities most affected by climate change often have the least influence in decision-making and the fewest resources to adapt. This creates a cycle where climate impacts reinforce existing vulnerabilities, making sustainable development harder to achieve.

Additionally, climate action is hindered by fragmented governance. Many sectors, waste, agriculture, energy, transport, operate in silos, slowing the adoption of integrated and systemic solutions. 

Finally, misinformation and low public awareness weaken collective action. Without strong social engagement, even well-designed policies face resistance or fail to scale.

While international agreements are increasingly ambitious, many vulnerable countries�especially in the Global South�do not have the financial resources, institutional capacity, or technological support to translate these commitments into concrete, scalable actions.

This gap is widened by three major issues. First, climate finance remains insufficient, slow to access, and often focused on mitigation rather than adaptation, even though frontline communities urgently need resilience measures against droughts, floods, and land degradation. Second, climate solutions are often designed without considering local realities or the knowledge of farmers, Indigenous peoples, and youth, leading to interventions that are either inappropriate or unsustainable. Third, political instability and competing socio-economic priorities make long-term climate planning difficult, particularly in regions where food security and employment remain pressing concerns.

Addressing climate change requires more than technical solutions�it requires governance reforms, equitable financing, and inclusive decision-making processes that ensure local communities are at the center of climate strategies. Empowering young leaders, strengthening local institutions, and investing in nature-based and community-driven solutions are essential to moving from commitments to action.

Waste is the shadow of the modern civilisation, and everywhere that shadow spreads, the climate crisis deepens.

When we overproduce, mountains of waste appear. When we overconsume, they grow taller. When industries chase convenience, landfills become landscapes. Everything we throw away becomes a tiny vote for more extraction, more pollution, more carbon.

Dumping waste poisons rivers. 
Mismanaged waste creates methane, one of the most potent climate-warming gases. Plastics infiltrate oceans and disrupt ecosystems.

One of the biggest challenges facing climate action today is the widespread lack of knowledge and awareness about climate change, its impacts, and the practical steps people can take. Many individuals, especially in developing regions, do not fully understand what climate change means, how it affects their daily lives, or why their personal actions matter. This gap in understanding slows community mobilization and limits the adoption of sustainable behaviors.

When awareness is low, climate change becomes an abstract idea rather than an urgent reality. Issues like flooding, heatwaves, pollution, and food insecurity are often seen as normal problems, not as signs of a worsening climate crisis. As a result, communities are less likely to support climate policies, reduce waste, or engage in solutions such as tree planting, recycling, and energy conservation.

A major part of this challenge is the limited accessibility of climate information. Many materials are too technical, not localized, or unavailable in native languages, making it difficult for youth, rural populations, and low-literacy groups to understand the message.

To overcome this, we need platforms that simplify climate information into clear, practical, and culturally relevant content, coupled with community-focused engagement that meets people where they are here is sample https://sites.google.com/view/envirolearn/home

Countries and corporations with the largest historical emissions still dominate negotiations, control climate finance&set technology standards, while communities on the frontlines-who face the worst impacts-have the least influence. As a result, climate decisions are often made by those who profit from extraction, not those working to restore ecosystems.
My experience with Green Nettle Textiles shows this clearly. In Kenya, we tried to replace 177,000 tonnes of imported textile waste,much of it synthetic and non-recyclable,with regenerative fibre from indigenous stinging nettles. Yet access to nature-based fibre processing technologies remains restricted through patents held mainly in the Global North, while companies producing synthetic, fossil-fuel-based fibres still dominate global markets. Local innovators creating circular, low-carbon alternatives face structural barriers not of their making.

Similarly, in our community agro-processing and dryland restoration work at Inua Damsite CBO, we see how climate finance rarely reaches grassroots groups, even though they deliver the most practical, culturally rooted, and cost-effective climate solutions.

The biggest obstacle is not a lack of solutions, but a governance: climate action is still shaped by those who contributed most to the problem, while those living the reality of climate change remain underfunded and unheard

We know what is happening; we understand the risks. Yet action often lags behind the pace of the crisis. This gap is most visible in the Global South, where communities already face water shortages, declining harvests, and environmental stress without the resources needed to respond.

I also see inequality as a critical barrier: those who contribute the least to climate change continue to suffer the most, while having the least access to support, financing, and decision-making spaces. Climate action cannot succeed if it leaves the most vulnerable behind.

Perhaps another challenge lies in the disconnection between global policies and local realities. Innovative ideas and strong research prevail, but too often they do not reach the very communities that need them most. For climate action to succeed, solutions must be accessible, pragmatic, and anchored in people's everyday lives.

Finally, young leaders are not yet fully empowered, even though our generation carries both the determination and long-term vision necessary for sustainable change.

The science clearly shows the need to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and transform the whole economic system. Political decisions remain slow, fragmented, or constrained by short-term interests, geopolitical tensions, and the influence of extrativist actors. For many countries in the Global South, ambition is limited not by willingness but by structural barriers: insufficient access to predictable and fair public climate finance, debt burdens and an international financial architecture that maintains dependency instead of enabling resilience, adaptation and a just transition. This created unequal conditions for action and undermines trust in the multilateral system. Another critical challenge is the rise of false or incomplete solutions, such as approaches to transition minerals that replicate extractivism, or unilateral measures that risk deepening inequalities. Without human rights, social protection and community participation at the core, climate action can unintentionally reproduce the injustices it seeks to solve.

While people across the continent are taking meaningful steps (adopting climate-smart practices in their daily lives, developing sustainable energy solutions, and innovating locally relevant approaches) many governments continue to prioritize short-term economic gains and capitalist interests over environmental sustainability and community welfare.

This manifests in multiple ways: countries selling off natural resources, heavily investing in unsustainable infrastructure such as private jets for elites, over-taxing innovators and entrepreneurs who are developing climate-friendly technologies, and implementing policies that oppress smallholder farmers, who are often the backbone of local food systems. Such actions not only undermine grassroots climate initiatives but also exacerbate inequality and vulnerability, making it harder for communities to adapt and thrive.

In essence, while individuals and communities are stepping up to combat climate change, government inertia, exploitation, and short-sighted policies remain a critical barrier.

This gap creates a cycle of climate inequality: communities with the least responsibility for emissions have the smallest voice in decision-making and the fewest resources to adapt. Young innovators face even greater barriers�limited funding, weak enabling environments, and structural exclusion from formal climate governance.

Another major challenge is the slow transition from linear to circular systems, especially in rapidly growing regions where waste, pollution, and resource pressure are rising faster than infrastructure and policy responses. Without scalable circular economy models, emissions from consumption will continue to rise.

Finally, climate action is slowed by fragmented coordination�solutions are developed in silos, preventing knowledge transfer, technology adoption, and cross-regional learning.

Financial Constraints: Developing countries are facing huge funding gaps in adapting to climate impacts. Current climate finance commitments remain well below needs.
- Political and Economic Pressures:
The powerful lobbies of fossil fuels, combined with competing national interests, often stand in opposition to choices that are sustainable over the long term.

Climate change interlinks with added challenges such as extreme weather conditions, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity; thus, immediate coordinated action is highly warranted.

Community engagement is often reduced to one consultation or a photo-op, instead of long-term dialogue, trust-building, and resourcing people to lead their own solutions.

Gender makes this gap even sharper. Women, trans and non-binary people are often the first to lose housing, income, safety and health in a crisis, but the last to be invited into decision-making.

However, global climate discussions rarely reflect these realities.

Policies are often shaped by institutions and actors far removed from the conditions on the ground. As a result, the experiences of women farmers struggling, young people growing up in displacement camps, and communities rebuilding after conflict are excluded from the spaces where solutions are designed.

622,"The challenge for climate action today in Africa, particularly regarding droughts, floods, soil degradation, and agricultural dependence, is the intersection of environmental vulnerability with socio-economic fragility. Climate change intensifies extreme weather events like droughts and floods, which severely impact soil health and agricultural productivity. Given that a large proportion of Africa�s population relies on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods, these climatic shocks translate directly into food insecurity, loss of income, and heightened poverty.
The lack of adaptive capacity in many rural communities due to limited access to technology, finance, and knowledge for climate-smart agricultural practices is a challenge. Soil degradation, driven by unsustainable farming and deforestation, further reduces resilience. Without investment in sustainable land management, restoration, and farmer education, the degrading environment will continue to trap communities in cycles of vulnerability.

Insufficient coordination between governments, local institutions, and international bodies slows down the scaling up of effective adaptation measures. Refugee and host communities, often marginalized, face particular challenges in accessing resources for climate resilience.
To overcome these challenges, climate action must be holistic, integrating social equity, economic empowerment, and environmental protection. ",0.78496194,0.47118098,0.5003555,0.6333531008573892,#f7e379

While global awareness has increased, the translation of scientific evidence into timely, well-funded, and locally responsive action remains severely limited.

First, climate risks are escalating faster than adaptation systems can evolve. Extreme heat, floods, and droughts now occur with greater frequency and intensity, yet most vulnerable countries especially across Asia and the Global South still lack adequate early-warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and long-term adaptation planning. My research on climate vulnerability and readiness shows a persistent cluster of countries trapped in high-risk, low-readiness conditions, reflecting structural barriers in governance, finance, and institutional capacity.

Second, climate finance is highly unequal. Adaptation receives only a fraction of global climate funding, and even when finance is pledged, disbursement is slow, fragmented, and burdened with complex procedures.

As a result, solutions can become overly academic, donor-driven, or designed for ideal conditions that do not match the constraints on the ground.

Smallholder farmers, who produce the majority of food across Africa, are facing the worst impacts of climate change: prolonged dry spells, declining soil fertility, and shrinking yields, yet they are rarely centered in conversations about adaptation. Many innovations fail not because they lack scientific merit, but because they do not reflect local realities, indigenous knowledge, or the day-to-day pressures of rural life. When the people who understand the land are excluded, climate action risks become disconnected, unsustainable, or dependent on continuous external support.

Another critical barrier is climate awareness and education. Many communities do not fully understand the causes and consequences of climate change, limiting the adoption of sustainable practices. This is compounded by climate misinformation and limited access to data, which reduces trust in interventions and slows progress on adaptation and mitigation efforts.

Finally, insufficient youth-centred approaches hinder progress. Young people are disproportionately affected by climate impacts but are often excluded from policy discussions and leadership roles. Without actively engaging youth as change agents, communities miss out on innovative, energy-driven solutions that could drive local climate action.

This gap is driven by three major barriers.
First, climate finance is insufficient, slow, and difficult for vulnerable nations to access. Communities on the frontlines often lack resources for early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, or environmental monitoring tools.

Second, many climate strategies are designed without meaningful local participation. Global and national policies do not always reflect the daily realities of communities facing floods, heatwaves, air pollution, and food insecurity, reducing effectiveness and limiting community ownership.

Third, there is a critical shortage of reliable data, skilled personnel, and technological capacity. Through my work in environmental health campaigns and my participation in an IoT competition focused on air quality monitoring, I have seen how the absence of real-time data weakens preparedness and response efforts.

I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is bridging the gap between global policies and local implementation. While frameworks like the Paris Agreement set ambitious targets, translating these into tangible, inclusive actions on the ground remains tricky. Often, communities in the Global South, who are most affected, lack resources, capacity, or a seat at decision-making tables.

There�s also a risk of one-size-fits-all solutions overlooking unique local contexts. For example, in Kenya, balancing immediate livelihood needs with long-term sustainability is a tightrope walk. We need more support for grassroots innovators, better funding flows, and policies that amplify community-led solutions. Strengthening partnerships between governments, organizations, and locals can drive more just, impactful change.

Adapting to the pace of climate impacts while ensuring equity and justice is critical. Empowering vulnerable communities with tools, knowledge, and finance will make climate action more effective and inclusive.

690,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is bridging the gap between ambition and implementation, particularly in financing and governance. While global commitments are strong, capital flows remain insufficient, fragmented, and risk?averse. Emerging markets, especially in the Global South, face barriers in accessing affordable finance for climate?smart agriculture, renewable energy, and resilience projects. This is compounded by weak institutional capacity, limited data, and policy misalignment. Without de?risking mechanisms, blended finance, and gender?responsive approaches, transformative projects struggle to scale.

Equally critical is the equity dimension: climate impacts disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, yet their voices are underrepresented in decision?making. Addressing climate action requires not only mobilizing billions in capital but ensuring inclusivity, transparency, and accountability.

To overcome this, we must integrate innovative finance, evidence?based research, and participatory governance. Guarantees, catalytic capital, and local fund managers can unlock private investment. Nexus approaches linking water, energy, food, and health can guide systemic solutions.

691,"Challenges for climate action today is the gap between what needs to be done and what is actually being done. Around the world, we already know the science, the risks, and the solutions, but real action is often too slow because of politics, limited funding, and a lack of coordination. Many governments and industries still prioritise short-term profits over long-term sustainability, which holds back progress.

For countries in Pacific, the challenge is even greater. Pacific regions is on the frontlines of climate change, facing rising sea levels, stronger storms, food insecurity, and the loss of traditional lands. Yet we have fewer resources, limited climate finance, and weak infrastructure to adapt to these impacts. Many communities depend on natural resources for survival, so climate change threatens both our culture and our livelihood.

There is also a global challenge of inequality. Countries that contribute the least to climate change, like PNG and many Pacific islands, suffer the most, while major polluters are slow to reduce emissions. This imbalance makes climate justice difficult to achieve.
To overcome these challenges, the world needs stronger political will, fairer climate financing, better inclusion of youth and frontline communities, and genuine global cooperation to protect people, cultures, and the planet.",0.65612435,0.26991922,0.63173306,0.7550659593138485,#f3a134
692,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the growing gap between global commitments and the lived realities of the communities most affected. While governments make pledges and design policies, these decisions often fail to address the deep social inequalities that shape climate vulnerability. As a result, climate responses do not fully reach or protect marginalized groups, especially in regions like the Caribbean where climate shocks collide with economic hardship, limited resources, and social exclusion.

Climate action is still too often treated as a purely environmental or technical issue, instead of a human rights and justice issue. Communities such as transgender and gender nonconforming people, who already face barriers to housing, employment, and access to emergency shelters, are frequently left out of national planning and disaster response efforts. When those most at risk are excluded from decision making, policies cannot meet the full diversity of needs across the population.

Another challenge is the rise of anti rights movements, which restrict civic space and weaken efforts to build inclusive climate policies. This makes it harder for civil society to advocate, hold governments accountable, and participate in climate governance.

This disconnect creates what the speakers described as a �civilization fog�, where people continue with urban routines without recognising how climate risks shape food systems, water security, and community resilience.

My experience at CarbonFarm shows this gap clearly. Rice is central to daily life, yet most people are unaware of the water use and methane emissions behind its production.This gap between consumption and production limits public understanding and reduces motivation for sustainable choices. Another challenge is maintaining public engagement. Awareness rises during extreme events, then fades quickly. Climate action needs steady participation from institutions, farmers, and urban communities, yet this is hard to sustain without clear messaging and information people can easily relate to their daily lives.

Communities near galamsey sites face polluted water that affects everything from food preparation to basic hygiene. There are young people who cannot drink from their local streams anymore and mothers who worry about the impact of contaminated water on pregnancy and newborn health. These are climate pressures mixed with environmental damage, and people feel the consequences long before any policy document acknowledges them.
Young people care, but many feel shut out of the formal conversation. They hear targets that do not match their daily reality and promises of support that are slow, partial or never delivered. It is difficult to trust a system that talks about ambition while communities deal with poisoned rivers and schools without proper ventilation.To me, the issue is relevance. Climate action will not achieve its goals if it does not recognise the social and health consequences that communities face every day.

1) Risk Aversion: Investors often prefer proven, non-technical models over capital-intensive deep-tech hardware.

2) Infrastructure Mismatch: Decentralized solutions struggle to integrate with centralized policy and infrastructure planning.

In my work with the IUBC Foundation, I have seen communities affected by heat stress, unstable rainfall, and ecosystem loss trying to adapt with limited information and minimal assistance. Young people are motivated to lead, but they often lack climate data, structured learning opportunities, and platforms where their ideas can be tested and scaled. As a result, strong community ideas remain isolated instead of expanding into broader models.

Another major challenge is the lack of coordination across sectors. Climate action is linked with livelihoods, social cohesion, public health, and youth development. When efforts remain siloed, they miss the chance to build holistic resilience.

This gap is clear when new fossil fuel projects are approved, renewable energy deployment is delayed, or policies fail to reach the necessary scale. Economic pressures, lobbying from vested interests, and insufficient climate finance for developing nations further hinder progress.
Closing the implementation gap is crucial because it affects all other climate challenges, including fossil fuel lock in, inequity, and inconsistent policy action.

Second, weak coordination and fragmented policies prevent holistic, long-term solutions. Sectors such as agriculture, forestry, energy, and water often operate independently, making it difficult to implement integrated approaches like agroforestry, sustainable land management, or nature-based solutions at scale.

Third, socioeconomic pressures and short-term development priorities often override environmental considerations. Communities facing poverty, food insecurity, or land scarcity may find climate-friendly options difficult to adopt without strong support, incentives, and capacity building.

The second significant issue is the unfair financing of climate. Money used in adaptation is also prone to bureaucracy, is not transparent, or may not reach community levels where resilience is needed on an urgent basis. Societies that have been hit the hardest, like coastal dwellers in Bangladesh who have to face salinity intrusion, water pollution, and loss of livelihood, find it difficult to obtain resources that would either sustain them in the long run or provide early warning or nature-based solutions.

In addition, scientific studies and community wisdom are usually not well incorporated into policy-making.

One of the biggest challenges in climate action today is turning ambitious promises into real change. Many governments and organizations have set bold goals like reaching net-zero emissions or keeping global warming under 1.5�C but too often, the action needed to meet those goals is slow, underfunded, or missing entirely.

This gap is made worse by political delays, a lack of support for the most vulnerable countries, and our continued dependence on fossil fuels. In many places, climate policies either aren�t strong enough or aren�t being put into practice. 

Another issue is that too many communities still don�t have access to climate education or resources, which makes it harder for them to take part in solutions or build resilience.

To move forward, we need more political courage, fair and inclusive cooperation, better funding, and stronger support at the local level. Only then can we turn climate goals into real progress that protects both people and the planet.",0.9309094,0.23422635,0.5473217,0.8358735213308729,#f3a134

This creates confusion, damages public trust, and makes it harder for people to know which climate efforts are actually real. When sustainability becomes more of a marketing tool than a commitment, we lose valuable time that should be spent on real action. For me, the solution starts with transparency. People deserve clear, honest information about what impact they�re making, and what impact companies are actually having. Without transparent data and accountability, even good climate initiatives can feel meaningless.

This is one of the reasons I created CarbonFora. It�s a mobile app that rewards users for low-carbon habits with carbon tokens tracked through blockchain. Using blockchain makes every action and reward traceable and tamper-proof, so nothing can be exaggerated or hidden. The goal is to give people a tool they can trust, something that shows real impact instead of just claims. CarbonFora also fills a gap in the market: making climate action personal and easy for everyday people, not just companies or experts.

Climate action often remains centralized, while the most effective interventions, such as climate-smart agriculture, sustainable land management, and biodiversity conservation, must occur locally. In Ethiopia, drought, land degradation, and declining pollinator populations threaten livestock, food security, and rural livelihoods. Yet farmers often have limited access to climate information, technologies, and funding.

Another challenge is the insufficient integration of scientific research, indigenous knowledge, and policy frameworks. Local innovations, and youth-led initiatives are underrepresented in decision-making, even though they are critical for culturally appropriate and sustainable solutions.

She looked at me confused and said, ""But that's not my problem, it's a government issue."" That's when it hit me that so many people genuinely don't see themselves as part of the environmental equation.

The second issue is how we communicate climate action, especially to young Nigerians. The messaging is so flawed (always doom and gloom, always making people feel guilty or ignorant). Nobody wants to be lectured. Young people need to see real reasons why sustainable living benefits them directly. We need to communicate like a supportive friend, not a judgmental teacher. 

Then there's the money problem. 

Sustainable alternatives are expensive here. Solar panels, electric vehicles, and even reusable products cost way more than the polluting options.

Many people understand that climate change is a threat, but translating that awareness into consistent, collective action remains difficult. This gap is driven by several interconnected factors.
First, climate action often feels overwhelming or distant, especially for communities facing economic hardship or day to day survival challenges. When people lack resources or stable livelihoods, environmental issues become secondary, even though they are deeply affected by them. As a result, climate solutions must be paired with economic and social benefits to gain real traction.
Second, there is limited access to accurate information, practical tools, and localized solutions. Many climate messages are global, technical, or policy heavy, making them hard to apply in everyday life. Communities need simple, relatable, and affordable strategies for adaptation and mitigation.
Third, institutional and political delays slow down progress. Even where policies exist, enforcement can be weak, and long-term planning is often overshadowed by short-term priorities. This creates inconsistencies that weaken public trust and reduce the effectiveness of climate programs.

A major part of this gap is political and economic inertia. Short-term interests frequently outweigh long-term climate planning, making it difficult to pass or enforce ambitious climate policies. At the same time, financing for climate adaptation and mitigation remains insufficient, especially for vulnerable communities that are already experiencing the worst impacts.

Engagement becomes stronger when young people feel inspired, not lectured; when they see climate issues linked to their daily realities like food prices, floods, or droughts; and when they feel their voice truly matters.

Another challenge is that many African youth have the passion, but lack access to information, tools, and spaces to participate. Without exposure to climate & green finance opportunities, digital platforms or policy processes, their potential goes untapped.

755,"The most pervasive challenge is the disconnect between global policy frameworks and localised, contextual implementation, which exacerbates the issue of climate injustice.

While international agreements and national targets are crucial, they often fail to account for the vast disparities in capacity, resources, and immediate vulnerabilities between regions like the European Union and the Global South. A policy designed in Brussels may prescribe a rapid transition to renewables, but without accessible financing mechanisms and technology transfer, it is often unattainable for local communities in Nigeria who are simultaneously grappling with energy poverty and economic development.

This top-down approach can overlook indigenous knowledge and community-specific needs, leading to resistance or failed initiatives. The result is a ""one-size-fits-all"" strategy that lacks the granularity required for effective, global change.

The solution lies in fostering bi-directional dialogue and co-creation. Global climate action must be reframed to prioritise empowering local actors. This means creating direct channels for grassroots organisations, like my PLUV Foundation, to input into policy design and ensuring green funding is decentralised and accessible.

756,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the ""decarbonisation divide"", wherein the ""Global South"", which contributes least to historical emissions, bears disproportionate burdens of both climate impacts and the unintended consequences of climate solutions designed elsewhere. This manifests acutely in the energy transitions: while solar deployment accelerates across Africa, inadequate waste management infrastructure creates looming environmental crises that threaten the very sustainability these technologies promise. My research on solar electronic waste reveals this paradox. As the continent installs gigawatts of renewable capacity, battery waste already generates 3.5-4.7 kg of lead pollution per unit through informal recycling in countries like Malawi. Without circular economy frameworks embedded from the outset, Africa risks trading energy poverty for environmental injustice. This ""rebound effect"", where technological advancement outpaces support systems, exemplifies how climate solutions can inadvertently harm the communities they aim to serve. Addressing this requires fundamentally rethinking climate finance and technology transfer. Northern climate investments must fund not just renewable energy deployment but the entire ecosystem: waste management infrastructure, capacity building, regulatory frameworks, and regional recycling hubs. Otherwise, we perpetuate colonial patterns where Africa becomes a dumping ground for the externalities of ""green"" technologies.",0.5102999,0.60295784,0.72224665,0.6062049019103956,#f7e379
757,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the widening implementation gap between global climate ambition and the real capacities needed to deliver it. Even with strong scientific consensus and rising commitments, many countries lack the institutional coordination, financing structures, and technology-deployment systems required for meaningful decarbonization.

A major driver of this gap is the inequality between the Global North and Global South. Developed economies can scale clean technologies and mobilize climate finance quickly, while developing countries face limited capital access, fragile energy infrastructure, and urgent socio-economic priorities. This imbalance slows collective climate progress.

Another barrier is the misalignment between rapid technological innovation and slower policy evolution. Advances in storage, mobility electrification, and renewable energy often remain underused because regulatory frameworks and market incentives cannot adapt at the same pace. Without integrated policy environments, new technologies struggle to reach scale.

Short political cycles further constrain long-term climate planning, creating instability in governance and hindering sustained action.

However, these findings rarely translate into timely national responses or strategies, there are no designated monitoring frameworks and political will remains weak in countries like Uganda. 
A second dimension of the challenge is the exclusion of young people from meaningful participation in matters climate change. Youth-led action in forest restoration, waste management and circular economy initiatives is growing, yet these contributions are seldom reflected in NDC processes or national climate policies. Without the valuable feedback from these youth groups - many of which operate at the grassroots level - climate action risks being disconnected from innovations happening on the ground.

Meanwhile, climate narratives are still too technocratic, leaving out the social, cultural, and justice dimensions that are essential for real transformation.

While many people understand that climate change is a real and urgent issue, translating that awareness into consistent, collective action remains difficult. This gap is driven by several interconnected factors.

A major issue is limited political will and policy enforcement. Many governments acknowledge climate risks but are slow to adopt strong policies or invest in long-term sustainable solutions, often due to economic pressures, competing priorities, or political interests. Without firm leadership and accountability, climate commitments remain largely theoretical.

Another challenge is unequal access to resources. Developing nations, local communities, and vulnerable populations often lack the financial, technological, and infrastructural capacity to adapt or transition to greener alternatives. This inequality makes global climate goals harder to achieve because the burden is unevenly shared.

Additionally, misinformation and climate fatigue weaken public motivation.

While ambitious climate agreements and transition strategies exist, their implementation often fails to reach farmers, youth, and marginalized groups who experience climate impacts most intensely.

Climate information rarely reaches rural communities in a form they can apply, and many solutions are designed without their lived experience in mind. This makes climate action less inclusive and less effective. 
Another significant challenge is the slow pace of transitioning from extractive to regenerative and climate smart practices. Food systems continue to rely on approaches that degrade soils, reduce biodiversity, and increase vulnerability to droughts and floods. To overcome these barriers, climate action must center on equity, local empowerment, and accessible innovation. Policies should bridge scientific research with farmer-led solutions, ensure financing reaches frontline communities, and promote resilient crops and diversified farming systems.

789,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today particularly in Malawi is the limited capacity to translate climate awareness into coordinated, sustained, and well-resourced action at community and national levels. While communities increasingly understand the impacts of climate change, such as floods, cyclones, prolonged dry spells, and declining agricultural productivity, the systems needed to respond effectively remain constrained.

A major obstacle is inadequate financing for climate-resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and community-based adaptation initiatives. Many local councils and community structures lack the resources, technologies, and technical expertise required to implement mitigation and adaptation strategies at scale. This is compounded by dependence on rain-fed agriculture, rapid population growth, and environmental degradation factors that intensify vulnerability.

Another challenge is the gap between policy and implementation. Malawi has strong climate policies on paper, but coordination across sectors, institutions, and districts remains limited. As a result, climate action often becomes reactive rather than preventive.

Many lack the skills required for climate planning, risk assessment, and adaptation strategies. Even when policies exist, weak coordination and governance prevent them from being effectively implemented.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and meaningful implementation. Although climate change is widely recognized as a global crisis, many governments, institutions, and communities struggle to translate this awareness into coordinated, long-term action. This implementation gap is driven by several interconnected issues.

First, limited financing remains a major barrier. Many developing countries, which are most vulnerable to climate impacts, lack sufficient resources to invest in adaptation, clean energy, environmental restoration, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Without predictable funding, even well-designed plans cannot be executed effectively.

Second, weak political will and inconsistent policies undermine progress. Climate policies often shift with administrations, and short-term political interests overshadow long-term environmental commitments.

Third, there is a challenge of public engagement. While people understand climate change in general terms, they often struggle to see how their daily actions contribute to the problem or the solution. This disconnect limits community-driven initiatives and slows the adoption of sustainable behaviors.

Climate action also struggles because it is fragmented and siloed, disconnected from health, education, and social policy. Solutions must link mitigation with adaptation, finance with local implementation, and global agreements with local realities. Diplomacy is not only countries talking, it�s about empowering communities to hold decision-makers accountable and ensuring commitments translate into tangible, life-saving action.

Despite international agreements like the Paris Agreement, global efforts to curb emissions are falling far short of the targets required to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This shortfall is due to continued reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, insufficient investment in renewable energy and infrastructure, and delays in transforming high-emission sectors such as industry, transport, and agriculture.Additionally, the challenge is compounded by insufficient financial flows, technology development, and capacity building in vulnerable regions, particularly in the Global South. Lack of effective climate governance mechanisms and the need for large-scale carbon removal further exacerbate the issue.

831,"I have come to believe that the hardest challenge in climate action today is the widening gap between those shaping global solutions and the communities living with the daily strain of climate stress. This belief comes from lived encounters: speaking with boda riders in Kenya who rely on the charging corridors we built, meeting families in Ugandan mining regions whose livelihoods shift with every unpredictable season, and working with conservation teams in Cameroon whose progress can be undone by a single ecological disruption. These moments taught me that climate action collapses when it ignores the realities of the people it is meant to serve.
Yet, in many conversations, especially in European policy environments, assumptions about stable grids, predictable markets and resilient infrastructure overshadow the constraints that define much of Sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, African insights on adaptation, informal energy systems, and community resilience rarely shape global models. This disconnect produces solutions that look compelling in theory but crumble under real conditions.
My work at the intersection of computer science, energy systems and policy has shown me how generative AI can help close this gap. By combining scattered datasets with community-level observations, we can build models that capture how various climate action systems, from energy to food insecurity, behave in resource-limited settings, offering tools that genuinely support local decision making.

While governments have committed to ambitious climate targets, implementation remains difficult. This challenge is especially clear in the energy sector, where competing political interests, uneven technological progress, and concerns about economic competitiveness continue to hinder the transition to low-carbon systems.

From my research on the political economy of energy transitions, I see how emerging technologies raise important questions about governance, equity, and long-term investment that are not yet adequately addressed in global climate planning. Without stronger political leadership and clearer frameworks for cooperation, promising innovations risk being delayed or deployed in ways that reinforce existing inequalities.

845,"In my opinion, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the increase of climate-induced forced displacement and the current inefficient climate finance framework to finance adaptation and mitigation measures in most climate-vulnerable countries. Developed nations, as already recognized by UNFCCC, are required to provide financial resources to developing countries to cover the implementation of national policies on climate change, as a compensation from their historical GhG emissions, which most contributed to the climate change impacts the world has faced today. However, governments have been hesitating into adopting stricter policies, to be held accountable for their contributions to climate change and therefore, to climate displacement. 
As communities that contributed the least to global emissions are the ones being affected first by the rising of sea levels, like Kiribati and Vanuatu and other Pacific islands, it is essential that countries that are historically most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions commit to financial commitments that still remain insufficient, unpredictable and difficult to access to actually protect communities' livelihoods and prevent forced displacement.

In many countries, especially across Africa, poor waste management systems make responsible environmental behaviour difficult. When communities have no recycling points or proper disposal options, dumping and burning become the only choices.

Another challenge is the slow shift from a linear economy to a circular one. Industries continue producing plastics and textiles faster than they can be recovered or reused. Even when sustainable innovations exist, they are often expensive or not adapted to local realities.

Climate action also struggles because many communities feel disconnected from global solutions. Without localised, low-cost approaches, climate action seems unrealistic for people focused on day-to-day survival.

848,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the deep exclusion gap between those most affected by climate change and those who are able to participate in shaping solutions. Climate impacts reach everyone, but meaningful engagement in climate decision-making remains limited to a small, highly connected group, typically, those with education, access to information, financial resources or the ability to travel. As a result, we are often designing climate solutions for communities that are not fully included in the process.
Several structural barriers drive this exclusion. High levels of illiteracy, complex climate terminology, and language barriers make climate discourse inaccessible for many frontline communities. Even when youth or local stakeholders understand the challenges intimately, they often lack the platforms, training, or translation tools needed to engage in national and international processes.
Additionally, visa restrictions prevent many young people from contributing to global climate dialogues.
These barriers reinforce unequal representation and silence voices from regions facing the most severe climate risks.

Much of the global conversation focuses on energy systems and high-level negotiations, while everyday drivers of emissions like overconsumption, fast fashion and waste rarely receive proportional attention.

In countries like Kenya, the challenge is compounded by waste colonialism: the Global South receives the waste generated by the Global North�s consumption patterns. For example, the second-hand clothing trade is framed as charity or opportunity, yet up to 40% of imported clothes are unsellable and end up polluting rivers, soil and informal settlements. Policy does not yet fully address these cross-border injustices.

Countries facing the harshest climate risks are also those with the least influence in shaping global rules. This power imbalance means that solutions sometimes fail to reflect the social, political, and economic ecosystems they are to serve.

Another challenge is fragmentation. Policymakers, researchers, innovators, and communities are frequently working in parallel rather than in partnership. As a result, promising technologies from renewable mini-grids to green hydrogen struggle to scale since they aren't embedded into local infrastructure or backed by sustainable finance.

For example, in agriculture, some policymakers focus on reducing emissions through technological interventions, while local communities may prioritize soil health, water availability, or crop diversity. Both approaches are valid, but if they are treated as equivalent or pursued in isolation, the outcomes can be limited�or even counterproductive. Similarly, global climate finance discussions often center on emission reduction metrics, while the communities most affected by loss and damage prioritize immediate resilience and adaptation needs. Without a common understanding of goals, contexts, and trade-offs, efforts risk talking past each other rather than building meaningful solutions.

While climate science is clear and commitments continue to be made, implementation remains slow, underfunded, and often disconnected from the systems that people depend on most, such as health, food, and energy.

A major driver of this gap is unequal access to finance, technology, and data. Countries facing the worst climate impacts (floods, droughts, cyclones and heatwaves) are the least equipped with the resources needed for adaptation and resilience. This leads to cascading failures: health systems become overstretched, infrastructure collapses, and essential services like emergency response and medical supply chains are disrupted, as I observed in my CAN Fellowship research on climate-related disruptions to blood distribution in Malawi. Another challenge is fragmented governance. Climate action requires coordinated decisions across sectors: health, transport, agriculture, environment, and digital systems, but institutions often work in silos, limiting the impact of national and global strategies. Last but not least, there is a growing trust deficit. Communities are increasingly sceptical of climate processes that feel distant, highly technical, or dominated by Global North voices. Without meaningful inclusion, climate action struggles to gain legitimacy and public support.",0.6463895,0.5435146,0.7459699,0.7428595109525172,#f3a134
856,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the lack of concrete commitments and accountability from major economies, particularly the US, China, and India, which are among the largest greenhouse gas emitters. The recent COP30 summit in Brazil highlighted the deep divisions among nations, with disagreements over fossil fuel phase-out, climate finance, and adaptation standard.

Developing countries are pushing for increased financial support to adapt to climate impacts, while developed nations are resisting new commitments. The absence of the US from COP30, due to President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, has also undermined global climate efforts.

Another significant challenge is the influence of fossil fuel lobbyists, who are blocking progress on climate action. The COP30 summit failed to agree on a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, despite the urgent need to reduce emissions.

To overcome these challenges, countries must prioritize cooperation, increase ambition, and ensure accountability for their climate commitments. The window for action is narrowing, and the consequences of inaction will be sever.

While international climate commitments, scientific knowledge, and advocacy have all grown, the people most affected by climate change�especially in fragile countries�still lack the resources, infrastructure, and political stability needed to turn these commitments into action.

In regions like Somalia, climate shocks such as droughts, floods, displacement, and climate-sensitive disease outbreaks are occurring faster than the systems designed to respond to them. Yet access to adaptation financing remains slow, complex, and heavily concentrated in countries with stronger administrative systems. This leaves frontline communities exposed, even though they contribute the least to global emissions.

Another major barrier is inequality. Climate action today is shaped by unequal power, funding, and technology access. Without more inclusive decision-making and equitable financing, the solutions developed globally will fail to meet the needs of countries most affected by climate impacts.

Implementation of policies is also hindered by lack of technical expertise locally, fragmented monitoring technologies, and corruption among others. I believe that, compared to funding, technical knowledge and technologies are equally essential if economies are to transition and achieve climate action goals. This trickles down to the need for awareness and sensitization campaigns in communities, as well as programs that encourage exchange and utilization of indigenous knowledge locally.

Even committed municipal officials face budget limits, poor data, skill shortages, and weak monitoring systems, making effective action difficult.

These governance gaps are reinforced by a capitalist system that concentrates wealth and leaves vulnerable communities to face the worst climate impacts.

My research with the EBRD revealed similar issues in Kenya, where agriculture highly vulnerable to climate shocks lacks supportive policies and tailored financial instruments to drive adaptation.

Together, these two challenges, insufficient adaptation finance and fragmented policy frameworks limit the ability of developing countries to protect communities, mobilise private capital and scale climate-resilient solutions. Strengthening both is essential for a just and equitable transition in the Global South.

886,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is not the lack of policies or environmental laws, because many countries already have strong legal frameworks. The real problem lies in the gap between legislation and concrete implementation, especially in the Global South. Laws remain ineffective when institutions lack the resources, coordination, or political will to apply them fully.
However, the deepest challenge is human behaviour and public awareness. Climate action cannot succeed if people do not understand the urgency of the crisis or do not feel responsible for contributing to solutions. Protecting the environment is often viewed as the government�s role, when in reality it is a shared responsibility that requires collective effort from individuals, communities, companies, and institutions.
Raising awareness, changing mindsets, and encouraging sustainable habits are essential steps that support any legal or policy framework. Without behavioural change, even the strongest climate policies will not achieve their goals.

Some of the key challenges include:
- Insufficient Climate Finance: Developing countries need significant financial support to adapt to climate change and transition to renewable energy.
- Fossil Fuel Dependence: The continued reliance on fossil fuels is driving emissions and hindering the transition to cleaner energy sources.
- Lack of Global Cooperation: Geopolitical tensions and conflicting priorities are undermining global efforts to address the climate crisis.
- Extreme Weather Events: The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events are putting pressure on governments to take action.

As a result, many effective solutions are never deployed or are implemented too late. Another challenge is the disconnect between global strategies and local realities. Through my work in refugee settlements and my research presented at AGU24 and the African Union, I have seen how climate pressures like water stress, land degradation, and mobility unfold at the community level.

This challenge is worsened by insufficient youth representation and the under-engagement of women and marginalised groups in decision-making, leading to solutions that may lack community ownership or long-term sustainability. Another issue is the prevalence of �projectisation,� where interventions are short-lived and donor-driven rather than embedded in local contexts for lasting impact. We must adopt models that empower local actors, promote intergenerational leadership, and align funding with both environmental priorities and socio-economic needs.

Another major challenge is the imbalance of power in global climate negotiations and decision making process. Policies are often shaped by the interests of rich nations, while the voices of women, young people, workers, Indigenous peoples and most vulnerable communities are still not fully included. This results in solutions that are distant from ground realities and do not match the needs of those facing the most severe impacts.

There is also growing misinformation, disinformation, political polarization and a focus on short term economic gains that delay the just transition away from fossil fuels. These trends weaken public trust and slow down the urgent action needed right now.

To overcome these challenges, the world needs stronger accountability, fair and accessible climate finance and meaningful engagement of young people, women, workers and frontline communities.

Another major challenge is the unequal impact of climate change. Vulnerable groups such as smallholder farmers, women, and low-income communities face the harshest effects�crop failure, flooding, heat stress�yet they have the least support to recover. This inequality slows down collective progress, because climate action cannot succeed if large parts of society are left behind.

Misinformation and low public engagement also remain barriers. Many people still do not fully understand climate risks or how their daily choices contribute to the problem. Without strong community engagement and behavioral change, policies alone cannot drive lasting results.

A lot of the conversations happen at international or national levels, but many communities, especially in developing countries, do not fully understand how climate issues relate to their immediate problems like food prices, flooding, health, or livelihood.

Another challenge is communication. Many people still don�t have access to simple, practical information about climate risks or what they can personally do. When people don�t see the connection to their own wellbeing, it�s hard for them to care or take action, even though they are often the ones most affected.

There�s also the reality of limited resources. In places where people are dealing with unemployment, insecurity, or weak infrastructure, climate action can easily feel secondary, even though these same challenges are made worse by climate change.

To overcome these challenges, climate action must become more community-centered.

Communities that contribute minimally to the crisis often bear its heaviest burdens, yet they are largely absent from global decision-making. This disconnect produces strategies that may look promising on paper but fail in practice because they overlook local realities. 
In Saint-Louis, this is evident as families watch the sea consume their homes, not due to impossible adaptation, but because institutions meant to protect them act too slowly and remain disconnected from lived experience. Young people sense the urgency in rising tides, declining fishing seasons, and unstable housing, yet our perspectives rarely influence policy. Compounding this is climate fatigue; the crisis's scale can induce paralysis, yet frontline communities have no choice but to rebuild and adapt continuously. Unequal access to resources further hampers progress, with grassroots and youth-led initiatives, often the most creative and contextually attuned, receiving minimal support while larger institutions dominate. 
Effective climate action requires centering frontline voices, empowering community-driven solutions, and framing the struggle as one of justice, dignity, and the right to a livable future.

Globally, high-tech industrial nations possess the resources and technology for a green transition but often lack the political urgency born of immediate crisis. Their challenge is moving from incremental policy to transformative action. Conversely, small, low-emitting countries like Haiti face the cruel paradox of being devastated by a crisis they did not create, without the financial or technical capacity to build resilience. In Haiti, the challenge is not a lack of will but a fight for survival amidst political instability and a crippling lack of investment. We see climate change not as a future threat, but as a daily multiplier of existing crises in food security, displacement, and social unrest.
Here in Brazil, I witness another facet: the tension between rapid development and environmental preservation. The challenge is forging an economic model that values standing forests and biodiversity as much as industrial output.
The solution lies in bridging this gap. We need equitable frameworks that ensure green technology and climate finance are not just available but are accessible and adapted to the specific contexts of the most vulnerable. Climate action must be globally coordinated but locally designed, or it will fail to address the stark realities on the ground.

Climate change disproportionately impacts marginalized populations who contribute the least to global emissions but face the harshest consequences. Without inclusive frameworks, climate action risks perpetuating existing inequalities and failing to address systemic injustices.

Furthermore, the political and economic interests influenced by fossil fuel dependence pose significant barriers to ambitious climate commitments and rapid transitions. This challenge is compounded by fragmented international cooperation and inconsistent policy implementation across regions. The lack of accessible financing and technology transfer for developing countries hampers their ability to build resilience and pursue sustainable pathways.

Three main barriers to broad deployment include financing, infrastructure and local capacity. A lot of clean technology requires large amounts of financing, reliable grids and trained people (conditions that do not exist in many parts of the developing world). As a result, the transition to clean energy is not uniform - some countries have rapidly adopted low-carbon energy solutions while other countries continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels.

Another barrier has been that many of the solutions have been designed without taking into account local maintenance or financial considerations. This creates a barrier for communities to adopt their use.

We must act now to deploy the technology to where it is needed, develop the capacity to support that technology, and design the products to be affordable, durable and easy to maintain by the users.

They are not only victims of climate impacts; they are frontline actors, leading community initiatives, developing solutions, and driving advocacy.

However, despite this readiness, youth remain largely excluded from meaningful decision-making spaces. In many national and local processes, they are invited as observers, not contributors. Their presence is symbolic rather than influential. This results in climate strategies that do not fully integrate the creativity, lived experience, and energy that young people can offer.

The real difficulty, therefore, is ensuring that youth engagement moves from tokenism to genuine participation.

918,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the growing gap between global ambitions and the realities faced by communities on the ground. While countries make bold commitments, the support needed to turn these commitments into practical, everyday solutions often falls short. This gap is most visible in places where climate impacts hit hardest, but resources are limited.

In many developing countries, climate action is slowed down by a mix of inadequate financing, weak institutional capacity, and limited access to technology. Communities want to adapt, but they lack the tools, information, and investment needed to act quickly. For example, farmers may understand the risks posed by unpredictable rainfall, yet they struggle to access climate-smart technologies or stable markets. Households may want cleaner energy, but affordability and infrastructure remain barriers.

Another challenge is the limited inclusion of local voices in decision-making. Policies are often designed far away from the people they aim to support, leading to solutions that do not fit cultural contexts or local priorities. This disconnect weakens trust and slows adoption.

919,"The greatest challenge for climate action, particularly in the Global South, is not a lack of capital or technology, but a fundamental gap in holistic implementation, communication, and inclusion.

This challenge manifests in three ways:

The Awareness and Language Barrier: Climate action remains an obscure scientific concept rather than an operational reality for many local actors. As I�ve witnessed while sensitizing SMEs, we fail to speak the ""people's language,"" preventing genuine buy-in and seeing climate risk as a direct threat to daily operations and livelihoods.

Gap in Systemic Implementation: Success requires a holistic, systems-based approach. In the Global South, effective climate action must begin with building resilient and efficient socio-economic structures. Launching isolated mitigation or adaptation projects without this resilient foundation means efforts are often inefficient or unsustainable.

Deficit in Bottom-Up Vision: We need to complement top-down policymaking with feasibility rooted in ground-level realities. The current challenge is the failure to include all local actors in the fight, which undermines policy effectiveness and makes large-scale solutions politically and logistically unfeasible.",0.7684901,0.45457703,0.737031,0.7480458646179653,#f3a134
920,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between climate policy and community realities especially in the Global South. While international frameworks are becoming more ambitious, many frontline communities still lack access to clean energy, climate finance, and youth-inclusive decision-making spaces. This creates a situation where climate action is discussed at global tables but implemented slowly or unevenly on the ground.

In Zambia, for example, households continue to depend heavily on charcoal for cooking, contributing to deforestation, indoor air pollution, and increased carbon emissions. Young innovators like myself see practical solutions such as clean cooking technologies, sustainable energy systems, and climate-education programs but scaling these innovations is difficult without accessible financing, technical support, and strong policy alignment.

Another major challenge is that climate narratives often overlook youth-led innovation. Young people have transformative ideas but lack platforms to develop them, mentorship to refine them, and funding to implement them. 

This delays progress in countries where youth make up the majority of the population.
Addressing these challenges requires bridging global policy with community needs, empowering youth with resources and leadership roles, and ensuring climate financing reaches innovators working at the local level.

While international frameworks and high-level targets are essential, they often fail to resonate with communities whose immediate priorities are economic stability, food security, and basic needs. This gap creates a critical deficit in public engagement and a sense of ownership, as top-down solutions can feel imposed and irrelevant to daily life.

Bridging this divide requires a fundamental shift to a ""glocal"" approach. The true test is no longer setting targets, but effectively translating them into actionable plans that deliver clear, local co-benefits�such as job creation, improved health, and energy resilience.

Also, some political decisions are not consistent or are influenced by short-term economic interests, which reduces the impact of environmental efforts. In addition, the lack of support and funding for small projects and innovations makes it harder for youth and communities to get involved effectively.

923,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today, particularly in Rivers State, Nigeria, where I am from and currently reside, is the combination of environmental degradation and limited community awareness about sustainable practices. The state faces significant ecological pressures, including oil pollution, gas flaring, deforestation, and urban waste mismanagement, which directly impact local ecosystems and public health. Despite the severity of these issues, many communities lack access to climate education, sustainable technologies, and resources that could enable proactive environmental stewardship.

Another critical challenge is the gap between policy and implementation. While Nigeria has environmental regulations and initiatives, enforcement is often weak, and local communities are not consistently engaged in decision-making. This results in unsustainable practices persisting, even in areas rich in natural resources.

Furthermore, youth engagement in climate action is still emerging, and there is limited integration of digital tools and innovation to drive scalable solutions. Bridging these gaps requires awareness campaigns, youth empowerment, and community-led initiatives that are measurable and sustainable.

Addressing these challenges in Rivers State and similar regions demands coordinated efforts between government, civil society, and local leaders, alongside capacity-building for young people.

Communities in the Global South, especially women, young people, and Indigenous groups, face the most severe consequences of climate change, yet they have the least influence over global policy, financing, and technology access. This imbalance leads to solutions that are often underfunded, top-down, and misaligned with local realities.

Another core challenge is the fragmentation of climate action. While governments, civil society, and global institutions all work toward climate goals, efforts are often siloed and lack the systems-level coordination needed to address climate change as a complex, interconnected issue. Policies do not always integrate social justice, economic inclusion, or gender equality, even though these factors directly shape resilience.

Finally, there is a persistent mismatch between climate ambition and implementation. Many countries announce bold targets, but lack the financing, political will, or capacity to execute them effectively. This creates uncertainty, slows progress, and leaves vulnerable communities behind.

Policy is often written at global tables but executed in local economies that run on informality, low infrastructure, and limited incentives.

Developing nations already face climate pressure, flooding, pollution, food insecurity. Yet most action plans struggle because they overlook local realities: informal waste pickers who form the backbone of recycling, households that burn waste because collection is inconsistent, farmers who have never been introduced to regenerative alternatives. Without economic incentives, behavioural change doesn�t scale. Without data, policy remains theory.

Climate action needs less talk and more systems thinking. We need climate solutions designed with communities, not for them. We need financial models that make sustainability profitable, not philanthropic. And we need policy that is informed by ground-level data, not predictions from afar.

Policies are sometimes disconnected from the daily lives of people in vulnerable areas, like coastal villages threatened by erosion and sea-level rise, or urban communities living with pollution and unmanaged waste.

Finally, meaningful youth participation is still limited. Young people are often invited to speak, but not always given real power in decision-making or access to resources for their initiatives.

While global commitments such as the $100 billion annual pledge exist, the actual flow of resources remains limited, delayed, or difficult to access. This prevents vulnerable nations and communities from implementing adaptation projects, developing resilient infrastructure, and transitioning to clean energy at the scale and speed required.
Another major challenge is the disconnect between global policies and local realities. Many climate strategies are designed at the international or national level but fail to fully incorporate local knowledge, community priorities, or indigenous practices. This results in solutions that are less effective or unsustainable in the long term.
Additionally, insufficient political will and the slow pace of policy implementation hinder progress. Even where climate commitments exist, enforcement is often weak due to competing interests, governance barriers, and limited institutional capacity.

While international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement set ambitious targets, translating these goals into tangible action at the community level often faces significant barriers. These include limited financial resources, inadequate technical capacity, weak infrastructure, and insufficient policy coordination.
Another critical challenge is the disparity between responsibility and vulnerability. Many communities most affected by climate change, such as small island states and rural forest-dependent populations, contribute minimally to global emissions but bear the brunt of climate impacts. This inequity complicates efforts to mobilize climate finance and technology transfer in a manner that is timely and effective.
Additionally, there is a persistent challenge in integrating climate action across sectors. Energy, agriculture, forestry, and urban planning are often addressed in silos, limiting the potential for holistic, nature-based, and sustainable solutions. Public awareness, community engagement, and inclusive governance are also crucial. 
Addressing these challenges requires inclusive approaches, bridging international support with local expertise, promoting community-led adaptation, and ensuring equitable access to finance and technology.

954,"Big Challenges for Climate Action Today

I believe that the lack of awareness and lack of will to change entrenched social and economic practices at the grassroots level are the biggest challenges to climate action today.

A good example in Timor-Leste is that while we know about the impacts of climate change-for example, floods and extremely high temperatures-few people have good knowledge about how to adapt to it. Because climate change is increasingly frequent, very hot weather is growing alarmingly. However, we continue with our practices of building houses using materials like brick and cement, contributing to an overheating and unsustainable environment in our cities and towns.

The challenge is not just about devising policies, but how to make sure that those policies can be followed and enforced by people according to their culture and daily life.

Education and effective advocacy campaigns are necessary to make people abandon the practices that are destructive to the environment, embracing nature-based solutions and making a shift to sustainable construction methodologies in adherence to the principles of integral ecology.",0.4840331,0.2655233,0.33184862,0.740735429221958,#f3a134
955,"The biggest challenge for climate action is the justice gap. Climate policies fail to center equity in who bears climate burdens and who receives protection.

In my Lagos schools research, I mapped flood vulnerability across educational infrastructure and discovered a pattern: institutions serving the poorest students sit in the highest flood-risk zones. Over 1 million students attend schools in high or very high flood-risk areas, while schools in wealthier neighbourhoods show significantly lower vulnerability. This reflects decades of development decisions, zoning policies treating certain neighbourhoods as expendable, and infrastructure investments prioritising some communities while neglecting others.

My work mapping climate displacement reveals this pattern replicates across the Global South. Vulnerable populations face compounding climate risks while adaptation resources and resilient infrastructure flow to communities with political power and economic resources.

This manifests through insufficient climate finance reaching frontline communities, inaccessible funding mechanisms, and governance structures excluding affected populations. Even when funds exist, bureaucratic complexity prevents money from reaching those who know their contexts best.

Until climate action centers equity by ensuring meaningful inclusion of affected communities in decision-making and recognition of marginalised voices, we would continue protecting the privileged while leaving the vulnerable.",0.43135166,0.5949855,0.74383867,0.6005650928756473,#f7e379
956,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the disconnect between global ambition and local implementation, especially in developing countries. While climate policies, pledges, and funding commitments exist at international and national levels, the communities most affected by climate impacts�smallholder farmers, women, youth, and low-income households�often struggle to access the technologies, financing, and knowledge needed to adapt.

A major driver of this gap is the limited accessibility of climate finance. Funding mechanisms are often complex, slow to disburse, and designed in ways that exclude grassroots actors. Smallholder farmers, for example, cannot easily meet collateral requirements or navigate the technical documentation needed to access financing for solar irrigation, clean energy, or climate-smart agriculture. As a result, climate solutions remain out of reach for the people who need them most.

Another challenge is the lack of locally relevant, scalable solutions. Many climate innovations are piloted but fail to move beyond small demonstrations due to limited market development, weak policy support, or insufficient investment in capacity building. Communities need solutions that are affordable, context-specific, and supported by strong extension services.

Cycling across Bangladesh I saw people redesign crops, build simple warning systems, and organise savings groups long before any project arrived, then at UN climate conferences I watched loss and damage debates that barely mentioned them. Climate action stalls when communities are treated as beneficiaries instead of co authors and when their evidence is not wired into how finance is designed and monitored. Closing this distance means changing who sits at the table, how risk is defined, and what counts as proof, and letting frontline actors help set metrics and own data so accountability runs both ways.

Policies, infrastructure, and funding packages are drafted as if everyone could read alert text messages, run to a shelter, work remotely during a heat wave, or relocate when the coast is flooded. The people who cannot do these things (due to disability, poverty, immigration status, age, or geography) are precisely those who face the most severe effects of climate change, yet they remain largely absent from the rooms where climate decisions are made.
And I think this is a capacity issue. When people who know what it feels like to evacuate a city without accessible transportation, or to deal with a power outage when you already depend on assistive technology, are not part of the conversation, climate policy becomes less realistic and more fragile, and we end up with beautiful strategies that break down at the first contact with a flooded street or a cyclone-hit informal settlement.

Another challenge is weak climate governance at local levels. Policies exist, but enforcement is limited, and community voices especially youth and women are often excluded from planning and decision-making. This creates solutions that do not fully address local needs or realities.

Climate action also competes with pressing social issues like poverty and food insecurity. For many households, immediate survival takes priority over long-term environmental practices unless support systems are in place.

Additionally, young people, despite their passion and creativity, still face barriers such as limited funding, mentorship, and platforms to scale their climate ideas.

While scientific solutions exist, the implementation of climate policies is often hindered by weak institutions, limited accountability, and insufficient legal frameworks to protect communities and natural resources.
Marginalized communities often face the worst effects of climate change, such as displacement, loss of livelihoods, and environmental damage, yet they have little say in decisions that affect them. This gap between policies and community needs causes resistance, limits adaptation, and blocks fair solutions. Another challenge is that governments and businesses often prioritize short-term economic growth over long-term sustainability, slowing progress toward global climate goals.
Tackling these challenges needs a full approach that links governance, justice, and community empowerment. Strengthening laws, promoting transparency, and including vulnerable groups in policymaking are as important as technical solutions. Climate action should reduce emissions while protecting human rights, promoting fairness, and supporting peace. As a legal reformer and peace advocate, I aim to connect law, policy, and community action so climate solutions are both effective and just. This is the path to sustainable, inclusive, and transformative climate action.

Many people know climate change is a threat, yet turning that knowledge into consistent action is still difficult. In many communities, daily struggles such as unemployment, limited resources, and lack of basic services make climate issues feel less urgent�even though these same communities are often the most affected by flooding, heatwaves, and pollution.Another major challenge is the lack of accessible and practical climate education. Many young people want to take action but do not know the right steps, available solutions, or how to create long-term impact. Misinformation also spreads easily, making it harder to build united efforts.

Weak policies and limited government support add to the problem. Sustainable choices�like clean energy, recycling, or better waste management�are often expensive or unavailable, making it difficult for people to participate. Climate solutions also require collaboration between governments, businesses, and communities, but this cooperation is not always strong or consistent.

To address these challenges, we need better climate education, stronger policies, and community-driven programs that make sustainable action easier and more affordable. Most importantly, we need a shift from simply knowing about climate change to actually taking consistent, collective action at every level of society.

2. *Youth & Community Exclusion*: Marginalized voices (youth, women, rural communities) lack platforms to shape policies. Solutions risk being top-down, missing local needs (e.g., drought tools vs. cultural farming practices).
3. *Adaptation Inertia*: Rapid impacts demand agility, but slow institutions, limited tech, and poverty-driven priorities hinder proactive measures. Malawi's farmers need drought seeds _and_ climate education � logistics and costs block this.

Bridging this gap requires: simplifying funding for local innovators, mandating inclusive co-design, and investing in grassroots capacity (training, tech tools). Partnerships between governments, NGOs, and changemakers can drive urgency. Empowering local enterprises like Emmtech boosts adaptation and community buy-in. The clock is ticking � equitable, localized action turns intent into impact. Collective push, not just promises, is key to overcoming this challenge and ensuring vulnerable communities aren't left behind.

While governments, donors, and institutions make ambitious climate promises, the translation of these commitments into practical, community-level solutions remains slow, uneven, and underfunded. This gap is especially visible in vulnerable regions like rural Sindh, where communities face recurring floods, droughts, heatwaves, and food insecurity but lack the resources, infrastructure, and knowledge to adapt.
Another critical challenge is the limited inclusion of local communities�especially women, youth, and marginalized groups�in climate decision-making. They are often the first to experience climate impacts but the last to be consulted when designing solutions. Without their involvement, climate interventions remain top-down, less effective, and unsustainable in the long term.
Misinformation and low awareness also hinder climate action. Many communities still do not understand climate risks, early warning messages, or climate-smart practices. This weakens preparedness and slows adoption of resilience measures such as water conservation, renewable energy, and climate-smart agriculture.

Governments and institutions are gradually recognizing the climate situation as an emergency transition that are well-supported financially is still unevenly and slowly done in different areas.

Communities in the frontline including refugees, displaced communities, and low-income people, face an even heavier weight. They occupy the worst-hit by climate change areas, and their opinion is the least considered in the global policy arena. Local solutions that could be deployed to make communities more resilient, like providing access to renewable energy, climate education, e-waste management and sustainable livelihoods, are often underfunded or implemented in a very limited way.

Moreover, a more serious issue is that the climate actions are most of the time not coordinated with the meaningful participation of the directly affected. The interventions run the risk of being incompatible with the ground realities if the youth, women, indigenous communities, and displaced populations are not included since these social groups represent the diversity of cultural, social, and practical realities that mostly determine the success or failure of the climate solutions.",0.6304617,0.54692745,0.9765868,0.6866901493652287,#f7e379

Additionally, there is often a gap between knowledge and action; even if individuals understand the seriousness of climate issues, systemic barriers such as limited resources, inadequate policies, and dependence on fossil fuels hinder meaningful progress.
Another major challenge is the influence of powerful industries that prioritize profit over environmental sustainability. These companies often lobby against stricter climate policies, delaying progress and undermining efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, political will and commitment vary greatly across different regions, which hampers the implementation of effective climate strategies at both national and local levels. For students, this can be very discouraging, as it sometimes feels like a struggle against deeply rooted interests and resistance to change.
Despite these obstacles, I believe that empowering young people through education, spreading awareness, and encouraging active participation can lead to significant change. Youth possess innovative ideas, energy, and determination to push for sustainable policies and community-led initiatives. Overcoming these barriers requires a collective effort combining youth advocacy, policy reforms, and corporate responsibility to ensure a healthier, sustainable future for everyone.

While climate action policies and targets have moved significantly ahead, translating these into actual emissions reduction and systemic change has remained difficult, particularly in complex economic and institutional contexts.

A driver of this is the uneven availability and quality of climate-related data, which restricts the ability of organizations and governments to assess risk properly, track progress, and make informed decisions. This is compounded by capacity constraints, especially in emerging and developing economies, where technical expertise, financing, and institutional readiness are usually lagging behind global expectations.

Furthermore, climate action often encounters competition from short-term economic priorities. The perceived trade-off between growth, competitiveness, and decarbonization can delay decisive action, particularly in carbon-intensive sectors. Fragmented regulatory approaches, misaligned incentives, and concerns over transition impacts on jobs and communities further complicate coordinated responses.

Many people understand that climate change is happening, and communities especially in the Global South are already feeling its effects. Yet political will is often lacking. Decisions get delayed, other priorities take over, and precious time is lost while impacts continue to grow.
Inequality is another major challenge. The communities that contribute least to global emissions are usually the ones suffering the most, yet they often have the smallest voice in global climate discussions. This makes it difficult to develop solutions that truly reflect the needs of those most affected.

2.	Persistent sectoral silos: Climate remains ghettoized as an �environment� issue. Health ministry�s budget for malaria without modelling vector shifts; urban planners build without flood-risk data; finance ministries treat adaptation as expenditure, not risk reduction. The result: collapsed cold chains, flooded clinics, and heat-exhausted workers.
3.	Systemic exclusion of frontline agency: Solutions are still designed in Brussels, Berlin, or Washington, then parachuted southward. Local practitioners and affected communities, especially women, indigenous groups, and sexual minorities are invited to validate rather than co-create, eroding ownership and effectiveness.

My cousin in Kinshasa was only 18, and her death could have been prevented if the drainage in her area wasn�t blocked.
This ignorance isn�t because people don�t care it�s because no one has taught them how their environment affects their safety. Without proper education, people underestimate dangers like poor waste management, deforestation, and uncontrolled construction. Climate action becomes difficult when communities don�t have access to climate information, don�t understand early warning signs, or don�t know how their behaviours contribute to the problem. To move forward, we must prioritize awareness, education, and simple community-based actions that empower people to protect themselves and their environment.",0.3260169,0.3817613,0.30280745,0.6365274205774467,#f7e379
1015,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is bridging the gap between urgent need and inadequate implementation. Despite growing awareness and initiatives, the pace of progress remains too slow to meet global climate targets. Several key hurdles stand in the way:
- *Inequitable Climate Finance*: Developing nations face significant barriers in accessing funding for climate mitigation and adaptation, exacerbating existing inequalities.
- *Geopolitical Uncertainties*: Ongoing conflicts and shifting priorities divert attention and resources away from climate action.
- *Insufficient Adaptation Funding*: Only a small share of climate funding goes towards adaptation, leaving vulnerable communities exposed to climate impacts.
- *Implementation Gaps*: Countries need to translate commitments into concrete actions, ensuring climate resilience and sustainability.
- *Technological and Capacity Constraints*: Limited access to green technologies and expertise hinders climate progress in developing nations.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is *global coordination and collective action*. Despite growing awareness, the urgency of the climate crisis, and advancements in technology, implementing effective solutions remains a significant hurdle.

Some key obstacles include:
Challenge	Description
Global Inequality	Disparities in resources, capacity, and priorities hinder international cooperation.
Political Will	Short-term interests often override long-term climate goals.
Public Engagement	Maintaining momentum and public support for climate action is crucial.
To overcome these challenges, we need:

- Increased global cooperation and diplomacy
- Stronger climate policies and regulations
- Individual and community-led initiatives
- Continuous innovation and technology sharing",0.7769029,0.14178884,0.29839635,0.8043543153474035,#f3a134
1018,"The greatest challenge for global climate action today is the implementation gap fueled by a persistent lack of equitable climate finance and political will, particularly in transitioning away from fossil fuels. As a young leader from the Global South, I see this gap not merely as an issue of technical difficulty, but one of deep climate justice. The recent COP discussions underscore this crisis: while countries submit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), their collective ambition remains significantly off-track to meet the 1.5�C target, primarily because many NDCs lack the necessary financial and technological support for implementation. Developing countries are disproportionately impacted, yet they face severe constraints in securing the promised funding for adaptation and mitigation. The failure of the recent COP to secure a unified roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels, often due to opposition from oil-producing states, highlights the political deadlock. This not only undermines the spirit of cooperation but forces nations like mine to rely on debt-based finance to address a crisis overwhelmingly caused by historical polluters. Attending Ideas Lab 2026 would allow me to better understand the policy levers within the EU needed to close this finance and implementation gap, translating my local efforts into a more effective global advocacy framework.",0.20559359,0.6278982,0.49447644,0.6768425503994403,#f7e379
1019,"In my view, the greatest challenge in today�s climate action is the gap between scientific knowledge, available solutions, and their actual adoption by local communities�especially in rural areas. As someone working daily with farmers in Zogbodom� through SAVE CLIME FOUNDATION, I see that climate solutions exist, but their impact remains limited when populations lack the technical capacity, financial means, or institutional support to implement them.

Rural communities are on the front line of climate change, yet they often receive the least support. The adoption of agroecology, agroforestry, soil regeneration practices, and perennial tree planting is slowed by insufficient awareness, limited access to inputs, and the absence of long-term support mechanisms. This disconnect perpetuates land degradation, reduces agricultural productivity, and increases vulnerability.

For me, the real challenge is therefore building a system that enables communities to appropriate climate solutions. This means strengthening local leadership, supporting youth engagement, improving access to climate finance, and ensuring that innovations are adapted to local realities.

Bridging this implementation gap is essential. Without it, even the best climate strategies will fail to deliver their full potential. My work aims precisely to close this gap by combining capacity-building, ecological restoration, and community empowerment.",0.43572426,0.6547155,0.557631,0.6679772485716955,#f7e379

We already understand the risks�rising temperatures, declining water resources, more frequent droughts�but turning this knowledge into practical, community-level adaptation is still limited. The communities most affected by climate change often lack the financial resources, technical support, and institutional capacity to put solutions into action.

In water-scarce countries like Jordan, this challenge is even greater. Climate models show clear warnings, such as the decline in rainfall and temperature increases I found in my research on the Kufranja Dam Catchment, yet local systems often struggle to respond. Farmers, schools, and municipalities may know that change is needed, but they lack tools, training, and long-term investment to adapt effectively.

Another major challenge is public engagement. Climate action cannot succeed if people see it as something distant or technical. Strong communication, inclusive decision-making, and youth involvement are essential to turning awareness into real resilience.

1021,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between global ambition and local reality. While policies, pledges, and technological solutions are advancing rapidly, they often fail to reach the root communities who are most vulnerable to climate impacts. This disconnection becomes clear in places like coastal and riverine Bangladesh, where people face rising water levels, erosion, displacement, and loss of livelihoods long before policies reach them.
A major part of this challenge is the lack of inclusive governance and community-centered or bottom-up planning. They experience climate change directly, yet they remain the least empowered to influence the solutions designed for them.
Another barrier is insufficient integration of local knowledge with scientific approaches. Communities already possess adaptive practices shaped by generations of environmental experience, but these insights are rarely recognized or scaled.
Additionally, climate action struggles with resource inequality, where funding, technology, and resilience tools remain concentrated in wealthier regions. This imbalance slows down mitigation and adaptation efforts in the Global South despite these areas being on the frontlines of climate risk. To conclude, In my opinion, the biggest challenge is not the lack of solutions rather ensuring that climate action becomes equitable, accessible, and community-driven for all.

1023,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is that many people know that climate change is a serious problem, but very few are taking consistent steps to reduce its impact. This can be caused by lack of knowledge, limited resources, or the belief that individual efforts do not make a difference.

Another major challenge is the high level of pollution and over-reliance on fossil fuels. Many communities, especially in developing countries, still depend on activities that produce a lot of carbon emissions. At the same time, access to clean energy and climate education is still limited.

Poor waste management is also a big issue. Plastics, burning rubbish, and littering continue to harm the environment because people do not have enough awareness or proper disposal systems. Young people want to participate in climate action, but they often lack platforms, support, and opportunities to turn their ideas into real projects.

Finally, climate change is moving faster than the solutions being implemented. Droughts, floods, and extreme weather events are increasing, yet many communities are not prepared.

To solve these challenges, we need more education, stronger community involvement, affordable clean-energy options, and platforms that empower youth voices�like Idea Labs, clubs, and local climate programs.

While climate science provides detailed data on hydrological extremes, translating this into actionable strategies is often limited, leaving communities exposed to droughts, floods, and other hazards. Integrating local and regional knowledge with global strategies is also a challenge, as adaptation plans often overlook context-specific socio-environmental conditions, such as snow-fed Himalayan basins where snowmelt and precipitation drive extreme events. Limited resources, governance constraints, and unequal access to climate finance further hinder timely action. Bridging this gap requires collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and local stakeholders to develop evidence-based, context-specific, and scalable solutions.

In my work, from just transition research to ecological restoration and community engagement, I have seen how climate initiatives/programmes struggle when communities are brought in too late or when participation is symbolic. This creates distrust and reinforces the feeling that climate action is being imposed rather than co-created.

A second challenge is the deep imbalance in power, resources, and access to technology. Countries and communities most affected by climate change have the least influence over global negotiations and limited access to finance, data, or powerful tools like earth observation. Without addressing these inequalities, even well-intentioned initiatives risk reinforcing existing vulnerabilities.

Finally, the urgency of transition often clashes with socio-economic insecurity. Communities dependent on coal, informal work, or climate-sensitive agriculture cannot prioritise long-term environmental goals without support for their immediate livelihoods.

This gap leads to slow implementation, weak community engagement, and solutions that often fail to match local realities. While global commitments and agreements are increasing, the people on the ground the youth, farmers, and low-income communities are not adequately included in decision-making, and therefore cannot fully participate in or benefit from climate action.

Another major challenge is that climate action still depends heavily on resources that many developing countries do not have: reliable data, digital tools, early-warning systems, and funding for community-level adaptation. Without these, even the best climate strategies remain inaccessible.

For climate action to succeed, we need a shift toward inclusive, community-centered, and locally led solutions where knowledge, technology, and financing reach those who need them most.

1028,"The Biggest Challenge for Climate Action Today
In my opinion, the biggest challenge today is not technological, but rather the effective coordination between global finance and local action.
The problem lies in the lack of access to climate finance for local solutions and young entrepreneurs in Africa. Despite billions in commitments (global carbon finance), there is a systemic disconnect:
Bankability Gap: Field projects (such as those in the green economy or sustainable agriculture) are often deemed ""unbankable"" because they lack the necessary technical structure to model their carbon impact and meet the complex requirements of donors. Digital and Measurement Gap: The lack of accessible digital tools and Critical Digital Literacy (CDL) prevents local actors from quantifying their impact in a standardized way (a problem that my ""Digital-Young-Greens"" project aims to solve).
 This challenge translates into a disconnect between political will and the capacity for implementation on the ground. Meeting this challenge requires democratizing carbon finance engineering and providing the digital skills necessary for global finance to effectively channel local solutions.

In Kogi State, we lose entire villages to floods caused by emissions we barely contributed to, yet the finance promised under the Paris Agreement � $100 billion a year � is still less than half delivered, and most of it comes as loans, not grants. Vulnerable communities end up deeper in debt while trying to survive a crisis they didn�t create.
At the same time, decision-making tables remain dominated by the biggest historical polluters. Youth and affected communities from the Global South are invited to speak but rarely given real voting power or funding control.

1031,"In my opinion the biggest challenge for climate action today is the widening gap between global commitments and the realities on the ground, where environmental degradation continues unchecked. Deforestation remains a critical issue, stripping ecosystems of biodiversity and reducing the planet�s natural capacity to absorb carbon. At the same time, the excessive use of fossil fuels drives greenhouse gas emissions upward, locking many economies into unsustainable energy patterns. Adding to this, unfiltered factory emissions and urban smog worsen air quality, directly harming public health while contributing to climate instability. These interconnected problems highlight how industrial practices, weak enforcement of environmental regulations, and short-term economic priorities undermine long-term sustainability.

1032,"I believe the biggest challenge for effective climate action today lies in the failure of political and budgetary prioritization, compounded by a critical struggle against misinformation and communication gaps.

 From my experience with local governments in Nepal, the primary obstacle is convincing policymakers that climate change is a core development priority. Governments consistently allocate huge portions of their budgets to immediately visible goals like infrastructural development. In contrast, they often hesitate to separate and prioritize sufficient budget for crucial long-term investments in climate adaptation and resilience. This failure to mainstream climate action into fiscal planning, such as climate budgeting, makes effective implementation challenging, regardless of the policies drafted.

 The second major hurdle is the proliferation of myths and misinformation that undermine public and policy understanding. There is a tendency in public discourse, including some activist circles, to blame every minor change in weather patterns or every single disaster on climate change without backing up statements with science or credible data. This oversimplification breeds confusion and fatigue, making it difficult to convey the genuine, systemic threat that climate change poses. Breaking these myths and restoring an evidence-based narrative is essential to convince both the public and policymakers that climate change is, in fact, the greatest threat today.

1033,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action is ensuring that responses are inclusive and gender-responsive. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by climate change due to social, economic, and cultural inequalities. In many rural communities, women are responsible for collecting water, fuel, and food, tasks that become more difficult as droughts, floods, and soil degradation intensify. These pressures threaten livelihoods, food security, and limit women�s participation in decision-making on climate strategies.

Despite this, women are critical agents of change, especially in agriculture, natural resource management, and community adaptation. Yet climate policies and programs often fail to recognize or leverage their leadership and knowledge. Limited integration of gender considerations into climate financing and governance further reduces the effectiveness of interventions and leaves women behind in both mitigation and adaptation efforts.

While the principles of circularity are well understood�reduce waste, upcycle resources, regenerate natural systems�the real barrier lies in implementation at scale. 

Global Cerah�s work illustrates this challenge firsthand. Across Southeast Asia, vast amounts of agricultural and food waste are still landfilled or burned, releasing methane and damaging ecosystems. Although farmers and industries recognize the environmental impact, many struggle with limited infrastructure, inconsistent waste collection, weak incentives, and a lack of accessible alternatives. This makes it difficult for them to shift toward more sustainable practices.

Our circular waste-to-resource model shows how climate action can accelerate: by upcycling organic waste into alternative feed and fertilizers, we reduce emissions, cut reliance on chemical inputs, and create economic value for farmers. But scaling this approach requires supportive regulations, investment in circular technologies, and stronger collaboration between governments, businesses, and local communities.

1045,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening implementation gap - the distance between ambitious global commitments and the capacity, financing, and governance needed to turn them into tangible outcomes. While policies and pledges have multiplied, actual transformation on the ground is often slow.

In India, this gap is shaped by rapid urbanisation, rising energy demand, climate-driven disasters, and the tension between development goals and environmental limits. Community-led solutions; such as water security systems, forest restoration, and circular economy models, have proven impact but are often constrained by fragmented governance, limited technical capacity, and insufficient local financing. Globally, similar patterns emerge: inconsistent climate finance, slow multilateral action, and inequities where the Global South bears the brunt of climate impacts despite contributing least to the crisis.

1048,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the rapid loss of forests through tree cutting. In many communities, especially in Malawi and other developing countries, trees are cleared for farming and charcoal production. While these activities help people survive, they also create long term problems such as late rainfall, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and reduced carbon absorption. This makes communities even more vulnerable to climate change. The challenge is that many people do not fully understand the long-term impact of deforestation, and even when they do, they often lack affordable alternatives.

The difficulty in addressing deforestation is that it is strongly linked to poverty and limited alternatives. In many areas, charcoal and firewood remain the most accessible sources of energy, so people continue cutting trees even without thinking of the long-term damage. Farmers also clear more land because they lack resources or training in sustainable practices like agroforestry or conservation farming. This makes it hard for communities to adopt better methods on their own. At the same time, enforcement of environmental laws is weak, and reforestation efforts are often inconsistent or not community led. 

To make real progress, there is need for stronger community education, more youth involvement, investment in sustainable technologies like using gas energy, and policies that support environmental protection while still meeting people�s daily needs.

Community members in regions affected immensely by climate changes need to be educated significantly on the importance of sufficient community participation and what actions to take in the wake of climate change. As such, capacity building and educational initiatives are paramount in effecting the desired measurable outcomes. The Global South is heavily impacted as most nations lack the essential regulatory framework, financing mechanisms, and institutional coordination that can effectively ground operations around ideal climate actions.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is not technology, funding, or even policy. It is the widening gap between what people know and what people feel. We have reports, data, and warnings, yet climate action struggles because many individuals, leaders, and institutions do not feel the urgency in a way that moves them to act. Climate change is still treated as a distant threat, an environmental issue to be managed, instead of a human story unfolding quietly in homes, markets, and farmlands.
This emotional and psychological distance creates three major barriers.
First, apathy. People see the crisis, but it does not feel personal enough to inspire change.
Second, disconnection. Communities do not see themselves in climate conversations that use technical language and global statistics.
Third, fatigue. Many people feel overwhelmed, believing their effort is too small to make a difference.
As a result, even the best climate solutions struggle to succeed because they lack the human connection needed for collective action.

1056,"The gap between awareness and meaningful action is, in my opinion, the largest obstacle facing climate action today. Although many people are aware of how urgent climate change is, it is still challenging to convert this understanding into long-term behavior, legislative changes, and systemic solutions. Communities, governments, and businesses are frequently prevented from implementing good climate strategies by social, economic, and political obstacles. Implementing sustainable solutions, for instance, can be hampered by a lack of resources, poor infrastructure, and short-term economic goals.
Global inequality is another significant issue. Despite having the fewest resources to adapt, communities most impacted by climate change frequently contribute the least to its causes. Equitable solutions that empower vulnerable populations and hold high-emission sectors accountable are therefore desperately needed.

Climate action is slowed down by misinformation, a lack of education, and political obstacles, leaving many people unclear of how to take effective action. To transform awareness into significant, equitable change, communities must be empowered, sustainable practices must be promoted, and collaboration must be encouraged.

However, most companies do not take this into account when engaging in certain harmful activities due to selfish interests. The Earth is the only planet that can sustain human life, so our actions will influence the longevity of humans and animals on the Earth. For instance, the activities of small-scale miners in the Ashanti region of Ghana have had adverse effects on the environment, particularly on water bodies and the forest reserves.

This gap is fueled by two interconnected issues. First, a lack of integrated, frontline-informed policy. Climate action is often siloed, treated as an environmental issue separate from health, agriculture, or economic development. For instance, a decarbonization strategy that doesn't account for its impact on local jobs or energy access in the Global South will face resistance and fail. Second, there is a profound deficit of climate justice. The communities least responsible for emissions are disproportionately bearing the impacts, yet they lack the resources and representation in policy-making to build resilience.
The true challenge, therefore, is not a lack of knowledge or goals, but a failure to weave climate action into the fabric of every sector and policy decision, ensuring it is equitable, funded, and locally led. Closing this gap requires moving beyond pledges to co-creating actionable, just, and inclusive solutions with those on the frontlines.",0.59246826,0.5167267,0.583006,0.7947528314713203,#f3a134
1080,"In my view, the biggest challenge for climate action today is insufficient and unreliable funding for developing countries. These countries are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts, including floods, droughts, and extreme weather, yet they receive only a small fraction of the finance needed to adapt, build resilience, and transition to low-carbon economies.

Even when funds are pledged, delivery is often slow, fragmented, or tied to complex conditions that make it difficult for countries to access or use effectively. This limits the ability of governments and communities to plan and implement climate solutions, creating a gap between commitments made at international negotiations and real-world action on the ground.

The lack of predictable finance also increases inequality, as poorer countries struggle to respond to climate impacts while wealthier nations and private actors continue to advance low-carbon projects. Without sufficient funding, developing countries face a choice between economic development and climate action, even though climate change poses immediate risks to both.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between global ambition and local implementation. Although many countries and institutions commit to climate goals, communities especially in conflict-affected and low-income regions struggle to access the resources, infrastructure, and support needed to turn those commitments into real, on-the-ground solutions. This disconnect slows progress, deepens inequalities, and leaves vulnerable communities behind.
A key part of this challenge is the lack of affordable and reliable financing for clean energy and climate resilience projects. Many regions, including Sudan, face damaged infrastructure, political instability, and limited institutional capacity, which makes it difficult to attract or manage climate investments. As a result, communities remain dependent on outdated or polluting energy systems despite their potential for renewable alternatives such as solar power.
Another major challenge is the limited participation of local communities and youth in decision-making. Climate solutions are often designed without the voices of those who are most affected, leading to interventions that are difficult to implement or sustain.

This means that there will be more deforestation to clear land for agriculture, prevalent use of chemicals, land and water degradation, and food waste and loss, among other problems associated with food systems. Therefore, according to reports, food systems contribute to about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, which is concerning and requires necessary efforts and policies to achieve net-zero emissions. However, I believe that conversely, food systems have the potential of redressing the climate crises that the world is facing because of avenues of opportunities, including the reduction of food waste and loss, regenerative agriculture, diet shifts, and adopting resilience and adaptation mechanisms.

As someone who studied hydrology, weather systems, and environmental change, I have seen how much difference reliable data and communication can make.

Funding is also a major barrier. Climate projects exist, but young people and local communities rarely get the resources to implement their ideas. Most solutions stay as concepts because there is no financial or technical support to scale them.

Additionally, misinformation, low public awareness, and inadequate climate education slow down individual and collective action. Many people still do not fully understand the urgency of climate change or the practical steps they can take.

We already know what works�clean energy, sustainable agriculture, waste reduction, climate education, and resilient infrastructure.

This gap is driven by three major issues. First is weak political will: climate policies often compete with short-term economic interests, leading to slow adoption of necessary reforms. Second is inequity in resources: communities that face the most severe effects, especially in developing countries, lack the finance, technology, and institutional support to adapt or transition sustainably. Finally, there is public disengagement, where climate change feels distant or overwhelming, making it hard to translate concern into consistent behavioral change.

As a result, communities remain vulnerable, youth voices are underutilized, and innovative ideas fail to scale.

1113,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and actual implementation. Many people recognize that climate change is a serious issue, yet the shift from understanding the problem to taking consistent, practical action remains slow. This gap exists for several reasons.

First, climate change often feels abstract or distant, so individuals and communities may not see how their daily habits contribute to the problem or to potential solutions. Second, there are economic and structural barriers: many communities lack access to affordable alternatives such as clean energy, proper waste management systems, or reliable climate information. Even when people want to make better choices, the supporting systems are not always available.

Another challenge is misinformation and lack of education. Conflicting messages about climate change can make people confused or doubtful, reducing motivation to act. At the global level, governments and institutions struggle to align policies, finance, and long-term commitments, slowing down large-scale solutions.

Overall, the biggest challenge is not a lack of ideas but a lack of coordinated action�from individuals, communities, businesses, and governments.

Local climate plans often sit on shelves without financing. Counties and cities prepare strong plans, but funding pathways stay unclear. This blocks progress and leaves important work unfinished. Plans lose value when they do not lead to action on the ground.
Duplication is another barrier. Different actors run similar assessments, collect the same data, or design separate projects in the same area. This wastes time and resources and confuses local partners. Strong coordination would reduce overlap and support faster progress.
Data gaps also limit climate decisions. Many fast growing cities lack current information on risk zones, land use, or exposure. Weak data leads to weak planning.
Financing systems also move slowly. Local groups and small governments work under pressure, yet funding rules remain heavy and complex.

1116,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the rapidly increasing impact of global warming, especially in Nepal. Melting Himalayan glaciers raise the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which can destroy villages, farmland, and infrastructure. Shrinking glaciers also lead to water shortages, affecting irrigation and daily life.

Erratic weather patterns further worsen the situation. Nepal faces unpredictable rainfall, long dry periods, and sudden flash floods, damaging crops, reducing soil fertility, and threatening food security. Many farmers are forced to leave their land, causing abandoned fields and loss of livelihoods.

Deforestation and poor land-use practices increase vulnerability. Degraded forests make landslides and soil erosion more frequent, particularly in hilly and mountainous areas. Communities with limited resources struggle to recover from repeated climate-related disasters.

Low awareness, limited financial support, and slow policy implementation make climate action harder. While people understand climate change is happening, many lack the knowledge and tools to adapt effectively.

Overall, the greatest challenge is the combination of rapidly rising climate impacts and the limited capacity of vulnerable communities to respond. Addressing this requires strong local action, education, sustainable farming and forestry practices, and long-term support from governments and organizations to build resilience and reduce risks.

Climate finance is limited, slow and inaccessible to local players. The same applies to communities such as mine in the Kakuma camp where the challenges of extreme heat conditions, lack of water and pollution are well-known, but the solutions are not given top-line priority and funding. This puts the individuals who are most impacted in a position of less influence over decisions and therefore the less support to develop some form of resilience.

Global inequitable decision-making is another problem. The youths, refugees, rural people, and those in conflict-affected states are seldom represented in the climate talks despite having the rich knowledge and practical experience. This underrepresentation curtails the efficacy and reasonability of climatic policies.

To proceed, the climate action has to be more inclusive, more grounded in the locality, have real investment support (not promises). The need to empower the youth leaders and communities at the grassroots is critical towards implementing change which is meaningful and long lasting.

One of the biggest challenges facing climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation. Although many people understand that climate change is a crisis, translating this awareness into practical action, strong policies, and sustained behavior change remains difficult. Several factors contribute to this challenge, including limited resources, lack of political commitment, inadequate funding for grassroots initiatives, and weak coordination among key stakeholders.

In many communities�especially in developing countries�the impacts of climate change are already visible through droughts, floods, food insecurity, and loss of livelihoods. However, the people most affected often lack access to information, technology, and financial support that would enable them to respond effectively. Youth and women, who are powerful drivers of change, are frequently excluded from decision-making spaces where climate strategies are developed.

Another major challenge is the widespread perception that climate action is the responsibility of governments or large organizations, rather than a shared responsibility that requires involvement from individuals, private sectors, and local communities. This slows progress and limits innovation.

Additionally, misinformation and lack of climate education continue to hinder meaningful participation, making it harder to build a unified and informed movement.

We have targets, treaties and technology, yet emission-heavy economic activities remain less risky and more profitable than compliance. The transition gap persists because rules still don�t shift market behaviour fast enough.
On the African continent, the challenge is compounded by a triple bind: Africa is under-financed, over-exposed to climate risk, and under-instrumented with trusted emissions intelligence and enforcement infrastructure. Many nations host high-emitting oil, gas and industrial assets but lack continuous MRV data systems, regulatory bite, and affordable transition capital. Without trusted data, carbon pricing, insurance models and climate bargaining power remain weak.
Ghana mirrors this in concentrated form. The country has built major energy infrastructure, including a national gas operator, but climate governance is still not structurally embedded in contracts, procurement and routine operations. First-of-its-kind MRV feasibility work shows the window for scale adoption is open now. Ghana�s biggest challenge is therefore governance adoption speed, turning feasibility into binding policy and multi-decade, institutionalised emissions transparency.",0.75358653,0.39263427,0.5047071,0.7695118588109083,#f3a134
1147,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation. People are increasingly aware of climate change, but the actions needed to match the scale of the crisis are still slow, under-funded, and often disconnected from the realities on the ground. In many African countries, the problem is even more complex. Limited access to climate education, weak environmental policies, low funding, and competing socioeconomic pressures make it harder for communities to prioritize long-term climate solutions over immediate survival needs.
Another major challenge is the lack of meaningful youth inclusion. Young people form the largest demographic in Africa, yet they are rarely given decision-making power or resources to lead innovative climate solutions. Young voices are often celebrated symbolically, but not supported structurally. This limits our ability to build long-lasting systems for resilience, environmental protection, and green economic growth.
Finally, misinformation and poor communication prevent many people from understanding how climate change directly affects health, food security, water access, and livelihoods. Without clear communication, it becomes difficult to mobilize communities or encourage behaviour change.
Addressing these challenges requires empowering young people, strengthening climate education, and increasing community-level action. When youth are equipped with the right skills, can drive powerful solutions.

While knowledge of climate change and its impacts has grown, translating that awareness into effective, large-scale action remains difficult. Policies often exist but lack proper enforcement, funding, or community engagement, limiting their impact. Many individuals and communities also face economic, social, or infrastructural barriers that prevent them from adopting sustainable practices. Another major challenge is inequality in responsibility and vulnerability. Developing countries and marginalized communities contribute the least to global emissions but face the harshest consequences, from extreme weather to food insecurity. This imbalance makes it difficult to create coordinated strategies that are both effective and fair.
Misinformation, political resistance, and short-term economic priorities further slow progress. Governments and businesses may prioritize immediate profit over sustainability, and public skepticism fueled by misinformation can reduce support for necessary climate measures.

In many parts of the Global South, where climate change impacts are most acutely felt, there is limited access to affordable, sustainable technologies. Economic constraints, lack of technical capacity, and political will exacerbate this issue. In addition, climate action must prioritise inclusivity, solutions should be accessible to vulnerable populations, including women, marginalised communities, and smallholder farmers, who are most affected but have few resources to adapt.

This slows innovation, weakens policy ambition, and prevents climate projects, especially in the Global South, from receiving the financing and support required to protect vulnerable communities. Without strong leadership from policymakers and the private sector, even the best grassroots initiatives struggle to create meaningful, long-term impact. To overcome this, climate action must be reframed as an economic and developmental opportunity. Clear incentives, accessible climate finance, and inclusive policymaking can encourage businesses and governments to see sustainability as beneficial rather than burdensome. Strengthening collaboration between innovators, communities, and decision-makers can also demonstrate practical pathways toward climate-resilient development.

Another major challenge is the imbalance between those who cause the most emissions and those who suffer the worst impacts. Communities that contribute least to climate change smallholder farmers, informal workers, and low-income neighbourhoods  are often hit first and hardest. Without fair support, climate action risks widening inequalities rather than reducing them.

There is also a disconnect between global policy discussions and the everyday experiences of people who live with climate shocks. Solutions are sometimes designed far from the communities who need them, which leads to low ownership and limited long-term impact. Local knowledge, youth voices, and community resilience strategies are still not used as widely as they should be.

In many African countries, including Zambia, climate action competes with everyday pressures such as unemployment, food insecurity, and underfunded public services. When people are struggling to afford basics, it becomes difficult to prioritise long-term climate considerations, no matter how urgent. This isn�t apathy; it�s a sign that climate solutions are still not designed with enough sensitivity to social and economic realities.

Another challenge is that climate financing rarely reaches the local level where it matters most. Community groups, schools, and youth organisations often have the willingness to act but not the resources to implement even small-scale solutions. Through my involvement in establishing a circular economy hub at Kabulonga Secondary School, I�ve seen how  (relatively) inexpensive but well-supported initiatives can inspire real behavioural change.

This barrier is not purely technical; it's a deeply entrenched problem that touches all others:

Political Inertia and Vested Interests: The global economy is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Powerful, well-funded industries actively lobby to delay or block climate policies that threaten their profitability. This translates into political systems that favor short-term economic gains over long-term planetary stability, often leading to a lack of decisive action in international forums (like the difficulty in securing agreements on a full fossil fuel phaseout at COPs).

The Mismatch of Timelines: Effective climate action requires massive, costly, upfront investments (like building renewable infrastructure) whose main benefits�avoided catastrophic impacts�will only be fully realized by future generations. This makes it difficult for politicians operating on short electoral cycles to justify the immediate economic pain to their current constituents.

Equitable Transition and Finance: Moving away from fossil fuels threatens the livelihoods of millions in energy-dependent regions (the ""Just Transition"" challenge).

1176,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real, large-scale implementation. Many people recognize that climate change is a serious problem, but turning that knowledge into consistent action�at individual, community, and national levels�remains difficult. Several factors contribute to this challenge:
?
?1. Economic and political barriers:
?Governments and industries often hesitate to adopt ambitious climate policies because they fear economic disruption or political backlash. Transitioning to clean energy, for example, requires major investment and long-term commitment.
?
?2. Dependence on fossil fuels:
?Much of the world still relies heavily on coal, oil, and gas for energy, transportation, and manufacturing. Shifting away from these sources is complex and costly, especially for developing countries.
?
?3. Misinformation and lack of education:
?Confusion or false information about climate science slows progress. When people don�t fully understand the causes or consequences of climate change, they are less likely to support strong action.
?
?4. Time pressure:
?Climate impacts are intensifying quickly, but large-scale solutions�like renewable infrastructure, climate-resilient cities, and sustainable food systems�take years to implement.
?
?Together, these challenges make climate action urgent but difficult, requiring global cooperation and long-term commitment.

From Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to numerous global frameworks, we have no shortage of written pledges. What remains lacking is the sustained political will required to implement them and achieve meaningful results. This gap has been further complicated by shifting geopolitics. The rise of Asian powers, most notably China, has intensified global competition, prompting the United States and European countries to recalibrate their strategies in ways that sometimes undermine coherent climate action. For instance, the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump has already strained humanitarian and sustainability efforts through funding cuts. I argue that these shifts are fueled by the broader geopolitical tensions, particularly the rise of China.

The EACOP case illustrates this contradiction. Western actors, despite championing a �rules-based order,� have struggled to maintain consistent positions, with some financial institutions and companies indirectly enabling a project they publicly criticise. China, meanwhile, has pledged to support only �clean� projects under its rebranded Belt and Road Initiative, yet continues to back EACOP, a project with far-reaching ecological, social, and economic consequences.

There is deep emotional weight in watching the soil and waters that raised you become more and more fragile, while global conversations continue at a distance. Too often, the focus is on the technical and abstract, but forgetting that it is the families, cultures, and the ancestral connection to land/country that are at stake.

Trust is another challenge. Our people are asked to be resilient, but support is slow, funding rarely reaches where it is meant to go, and solutions are designed without us. This again reinforces the divide between global promises and the realities at the local level.

Waste management is another major barrier. Plastics and glass continue to accumulate because recycling systems are weak or unavailable. Even when people want to recycle, few facilities can turn waste into useful products, leading to pollution and greater climate vulnerability.

Youth engagement is also limited. Young innovators have strong ideas, but lack mentorship, platforms, or funding to develop their solutions. As a result, many promising ideas never grow.

A major issue is limited access to climate education.

Without this knowledge, it becomes harder for communities to take meaningful action or to participate in national climate goals.

Another challenge is the lack of resources and coordinated efforts. While policies may exist, many local communities lack the funding, tools, and support needed to implement climate programs. This results in slow progress, even when people are willing to participate.

In countries like Nepal�where the informal sector drives waste, agriculture, and urban services�these models simply don�t fit. When solutions are expensive, complex, or detached from daily realities, they fail to scale.

Another challenge is the imbalance of power in global climate decisions. Nations facing the worst climate impacts often have the least influence in shaping policies or finance mechanisms. As a result, global strategies frequently look good on paper but fall apart locally.

Climate action is also fragmented. Governments, private sector, and communities work in silos, leading to duplication, inefficiency, and slow progress.

I saw this gap while volunteering with the UK Youth Methane Campaign. We weren�t just raising awareness, we were trying to shift how people think about urgency. And that�s the deeper challenge: climate action often gets stuck in distant targets and technical language, when what we need is clarity, courage, and connection.

We need to stop waiting for perfect solutions and start listening to what�s already working, especially in communities that are quietly doing the work.

Climate impacts are increasing every year�extreme weather, displacement, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss yet many commitments remain insufficient, delayed, or not implemented at all.
A key difficulty is climate injustice. The communities that suffer the most, especially in the Global South, have the least resources to adapt and the smallest voice in global decision-making. Young people, local communities, and vulnerable groups are often excluded from the processes that shape their own future, even though they carry the heaviest burden of the crisis.
Another major challenge is the lack of climate education and access to reliable information, particularly in conflict-affected regions. Without knowledge or tools, many communities cannot fully understand the risks, prepare, or mobilize for change.
Climate action is also slowed by the fragmentation of initiatives. Many good ideas and solutions exist, but they remain isolated, underfunded, or disconnected from the needs of the most affected populations.

This results in delayed policies, underfunded climate programs, and fragmented efforts across sectors and countries.
Another barrier is inequality. Vulnerable communities, who contribute the least to global emissions, face the greatest climate impacts and often lack access to resources, representation, or decision-making power.

The challenge is not only environmental; it is deeply social and economic. Millions of people, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, depend directly on land for food, income, and cultural identity. Yet climate policies often remain distant from their realities. The biggest barrier is that those most affected-women, youth, Indigenous peoples, and rural communities-are not sufficiently included in decision-making or financed to implement solutions.

Many countries announce ambitious climate goals, yet implementation remains slow due to political barriers, limited financial resources, and competing economic priorities. This gap reduces the impact of climate agreements and delays effective action.
Another major challenge is weak public awareness. Many people still perceive climate change as a distant issue, which limits community engagement and reduces support for sustainable policies. Without strong local participation, efforts to reduce emissions or protect natural resources cannot reach their full potential.
Vulnerable communities in developing countries face additional difficulties, as they often lack the tools and funding needed to adapt to rising temperatures, water shortages, and environmental degradation. This increases inequality and highlights the need for fair climate financing and stronger international cooperation.
Misinformation about climate science also creates confusion and slows policy adoption. Addressing this requires clearer communication, youth-led awareness efforts, and accessible educational initiatives.

1213,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation. Many people understand the problem, and governments make commitments, but the action on the ground is often slow. This gap comes from limited funding, weak political will, and systems that are not built to support long-term climate solutions. Communities that are most affected by climate impacts also have the least resources to adapt, which makes the problem even harder.
Another serious challenge is access to reliable data and clear information. Without good data, it is difficult to plan, monitor progress, or build effective policies. This affects everything from early warning systems to community planning and national strategies.
There is also a growing issue of trust. Some communities do not trust climate programmes because they feel excluded from the process. Others see climate initiatives as top-down ideas that do not match their daily realities. When people do not feel involved, change becomes slow.
Finally, climate technology and funding often stay concentrated in richer countries. This makes it hard for countries like Ghana to scale solutions that could protect lives and support development.

Nigeria is one of the world's top 25 highest emitters, contributing 0.8% of global emissions, mainly from oil and gas production,  land use change, and agriculture. So, the fossil fuel industry's influence and the government's subsidies for oil and gas companies hinder the transition to renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. 
Basically around the world, the biggest challenge for climate change today is the continued reliance on fossil fuel and the lack of genuine plan to phase them out. Despite the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  fossil fuel remains the primary source of energy,  accounting for 86% of carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade.

Policies are frequently designed without meaningful consultation with those most affected, such as farmers, youth, indigenous groups, and flood-prone communities. As a result, solutions appear strong on paper but fail in practice. Short-term political interests and economic pressures further weaken long-term climate planning and accountability.

Misinformation and limited public awareness also restrict collective action, turning climate response into an elite-driven agenda instead of a shared movement.

Ultimately, the greatest challenge is not a lack of ideas or technology, but the absence of coordinated, justice-centered action that meaningfully bridges policy, science, and community realities.

1217,"I think the biggest challenge for climate action today is the world�s heavy reliance on fossil fuels. It�s simple but huge: coal, oil, and gas still supply most of the energy we use, and they�re responsible for around 80% of global carbon emissions. In 2022, the world emitted a record 36.6 billion tons of CO?, and projections show that number could keep growing if real changes aren�t made.

The problem is not just environmental it�s also economic and political. Many countries, especially in the developing world, depend on fossil fuels to power their economies and provide jobs. Shifting to clean energy takes money, technology, and political will, and that makes change slow and complicated.

Even when people know the risks, it�s hard to put policies into action because the systems we rely on are so entrenched. Climate action needs a real transformation: energy, industry, and transport all have to change. Until fossil fuel dependency is tackled seriously, every other effort like adaptation, renewable projects, or community awareness can only do so much.

In short, fossil fuels are the core challenge. Addressing this is the only way to make climate action meaningful, sustainable, and capable of protecting communities around the world from worsening climate impacts.

In Rwanda and other high-erosion regions, farmers experience climate change directly through soil degradation, unpredictable rainfall, and declining crop yields. These frontline impacts require context-specific solutions that are often overlooked in global negotiations. Yet, translating local knowledge into policy-relevant insights is difficult, limiting the effectiveness of climate finance and adaptation strategies.

Another challenge is the unequal distribution of responsibility and capacity: major emitters drive global climate risks, but low-income countries bear disproportionate impacts.

These challenges are even worse in regions with bimodal rainfall patterns and agricultural-dependent livelihoods. The northern region of Ghana being highly vulnerable due to dependence on rain-fed agriculture livelihoods. This single issue drives several interconnected challenges:

First, heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture; most households rely on crop farming, yet rainfall has become increasingly erratic. This exposes farmers to droughts, floods, and shorter growing seasons, making climate adaptation difficult.

Also, limited irrigation infrastructure; the region has very limited functional irrigation systems, so farmers cannot stabilize production during dry spells. Without irrigation, scaling climate-resilient farming is dawdling.

In Addition, poverty and limited financial resources, high poverty rates reduce farmers� ability to invest in climate-smart inputs such as drought-tolerant seeds, water-harvesting technologies, improved storage, or renewable energy solutions.

Moreover, land degradation and deforestation, bush fires, overgrazing, and fuel-wood dependence cause soil degradation, reducing productivity and undermining climate resilience.

Notwithstanding weak climate information systems, farmers often receive late or unreliable weather/climate forecasts, affecting planting decisions and increasing losses.

The real barrier is the governance gap which is the inability to build trustworthy, accountable, and data-driven systems that translate climate knowledge into action at scale. Countries are generating climate data, writing policies, and attracting funding, yet implementation collapses because institutions are slow, fragmented, and opaque.
This gap fuels everything else: weak adaptation planning, failed early-warning systems, mismanaged funds, and technology that never reaches frontline communities. Without strong governance, even the best tools such as AI models, renewable systems, climate finance operate in a vacuum.
We also face a coordination problem. Climate risks don�t respect sectors, but institutions still operate in silos. Agriculture, health, water, finance, and disaster response are treated as separate problems, so interventions rarely form a coherent resilience system.
If climate action is going to succeed, governance must evolve as fast as technology. We need transparent data architectures, integrated decision systems, and accountability mechanisms that force policies to become real outcomes.

Another major challenge is inequality. The communities most affected by climate change  rural families, refugees, women, and young people are often the least equipped to adapt. They lack access to information, funding, and technologies that could protect their livelihoods. When climate solutions are designed without them in mind, they become too expensive, too technical, or simply not relevant.

Financing also remains a barrier. Many young innovators have strong ideas for clean energy, water management, or climate resilience, but they struggle to find the support and mentorship needed to move from prototypes to real solutions. Without accessible funding pathways, even the most promising innovations remain stuck at the concept stage.

There is also a behavioral challenge: people react only when a disaster happens, then quickly return to old routines. But climate resilience requires consistent, long-term commitment, not temporary attention.

This disconnect slows adaptation planning, and exposes vulnerable communities especially in the Global South, to escalating climate risks. A second major challenge is global inequity in climate governance and resource distribution. Countries that contribute least to global emissions often experience the most severe impacts, yet they have limited access to climate finance, technology, and decision-making platforms where global climate priorities are shaped. This imbalance restricts the development of locally relevant solutions and prevents communities from building resilience in areas such as biodiversity conservation, water security, agriculture, and public health.

In recent years, unpredictable rainy seasons have led to both devastating droughts and floods, crippling farmers and causing nationwide electricity shortages. Our carbon footprint is minimal, yet we bear a disproportionate burden.

This reality creates a profound challenge of trust and equity in global negotiations. The perception that climate action could stifle our own development�a development that richer nations achieved without restraint�fuels hesitation. The biggest challenge is not just technological, but moral: bridging this divide to build a unified front.

Therefore, the solution must be as much about justice as it is about science. It requires developed nations to not only reduce their own emissions drastically but also to follow through on promises of climate finance and green technology transfer. This empowers countries like Zambia to leapfrog polluting development paths and build resilient, low-carbon economies. True global climate action depends on this partnership, where the most vulnerable are not merely victims, but active, supported participants in a shared future.",0.5712967,0.569312,0.38748467,0.6524395037075325,#f7e379
1276,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the widening adaptation finance gap, which limits the Global South�s ability to respond to escalating climate impacts. UNEP estimates that developing countries will need US$310�365 billion per year by 2035 for adaptation, yet global public adaptation finance reached only US$26 billion in 2023, around 1/12 of what is required. Africa alone needs roughly US$70 billion annually, but current flows remain far below this level.
This finance shortfall directly affects a second challenge: insufficient investment in green skills and green-job readiness. While global climate finance is increasing, it remains heavily skewed toward mitigation, leaving limited funding for resilience, local capacity building, or youth upskilling. As a result, countries with the world�s youngest population and greatest renewable potential lack the trained workforce needed to drive a just transition.
Together, the adaptation finance deficit and the underfunding of green industrial skills create structural barriers that leave the Global South highly vulnerable and unable to fully participate in the global green economy.",0.83854413,0.55231535,0.65152466,0.7074244229582987,#f3a134
1277,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between global commitments and practical implementation on the ground. While many countries and organizations have ambitious climate policies, real progress is slowed by limited financing, weak coordination, and the lack of climate-resilient systems in vulnerable regions.

For many communities�especially in places like Somalia�the impacts of climate change are already severe. Droughts, floods, water scarcity, and health emergencies are increasing, yet local institutions often lack the resources, technology, and infrastructure to respond effectively. This makes climate action reactive instead of proactive.

Another major challenge is that climate change is deeply connected to other issues: health, food security, migration, and conflict. These overlapping crises make it harder to implement long-term strategies because governments and partners are constantly responding to emergencies. At the same time, many young people and community leaders who understand the realities on the ground are not fully included in decision-making or planning processes.
Finally, misinformation and low public awareness in some regions weaken community participation, which is essential for sustainable solutions.

1278,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the continued reliance on fossil fuels, which is driving the climate crisis. Despite the urgent need to transition to renewable energy sources, fossil fuel consumption remains high, with coal, oil, and gas accounting for 86% of carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade. The influence of fossil fuel lobbyists at climate conferences is also a significant obstacle, with one in 25 attendees representing fossil fuel interests.

Another major challenge is the lack of political will and leadership to address the climate crisis. Many countries are not taking sufficient action to reduce emissions, and some are even rolling back climate policies. The recent COP30 summit in Brazil, for example, failed to produce a concrete plan to phase out fossil fuels.

Additionally, the climate crisis disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including those in developing countries, who contribute least to greenhouse gas emissions but are most vulnerable to climate impacts.

To overcome these challenges, it's essential to increase public pressure on governments to take bold climate action, accelerate the transition to renewable energy, and prioritize climate justice.

First, climate action is held back by inadequate political will and slow policy implementation. Many governments set ambitious goals but struggle to enforce them due to economic pressures, weak regulations, or short-term planning, delaying essential transitions in energy, agriculture, and urban development.

Second, climate impacts are deeply unequal. Communities that contribute the least to emissions�especially in the Global South�face the highest vulnerability. Limited adaptation resources, insufficient climate finance, and underrepresentation in global decision-making make resilience harder, leaving solutions incomplete and unjust.

Third, misinformation and poor communication weaken public understanding. As a journalist, I�ve seen how climate narratives can either empower communities or leave them disconnected. When information is unclear or politicized, mobilizing collective action becomes harder.

These issues often delay projects that mitigate the impact of climate change globally.  Access to climate information and early-warning systems is often limited or non-existent especially in rural communities despite these areas being the hardest hit by climate change.

Almost everyone agrees that climate change is real and dangerous, but when it comes to making real changes, in government policies, business decisions, or even our daily habits ,  things move painfully slowly.

A lot of this comes from competing priorities. Countries want to grow their economies, businesses want to cut costs, and people want convenience. Climate action often feels like something that can �wait,� even though it really can�t.

Another issue is inequality. The people who contribute the least to climate change are the ones suffering the worst effects, yet they have the fewest resources to adapt. This makes global action complicated because everyone is dealing with different realities.

There�s also confusion and exhaustion. With so much information  and misinformation  people get overwhelmed and unsure of what truly makes a difference. When you feel powerless, it�s easy to step back instead of act.

And finally, there�s a lack of long-term commitment. Climate change requires thinking beyond elections, business cycles, and quick wins. Many leaders struggle with that.

Overcoming this ""carbon lock-in"" and the fear of stranded assets requires massive, disruptive investment and regulatory will, which is often blocked by incumbent interests.
Short-Term Politics: Political systems operate on short electoral cycles, leading leaders to prioritize immediate, popular economic stability over the unpopular, systemic reforms needed for long-term climate security. This short-term focus delays essential policy implementation.
The Equity Stalemate: International progress is stalled by the issue of climate justice and finance. Wealthy nations, responsible for the bulk of historical emissions, have failed to deliver the necessary scale of financial and technological support to developing countries, who face the worst impacts.

Another major challenge is inequality. Communities that contribute the least to climate change often suffer the most severe impacts yet lack the resources to adapt. This deepens existing social and economic vulnerabilities, and without addressing these disparities, global climate solutions risk excluding those who are most affected.

Misinformation and political polarization also hinder collective action. Even with clear scientific evidence, public trust and unified decision-making remain fragile, delaying long-term planning.

1304,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is turning ideas into real action. Many countries have plans to fight climate change, but they are hard to put into practice because of limited money, resources, or support.

In Cambodia and other developing countries, people depend on farming and natural resources. Sometimes, protecting the environment conflicts with daily needs, making it hard to follow climate rules.

Another challenge is that people do not always know how climate change affects them. Without awareness, it is difficult to change behaviors and take action.

Finally, cooperation is not strong enough. Governments, businesses, and young people need to work together to solve climate problems, but often they work separately.

To overcome these challenges, we need better cooperation, more education about climate issues, more support for vulnerable communities, and active participation from youth. Everyone must work together to create real change.

1305,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between scientific consensus and political will. Despite overwhelming evidence from climate scientists about the urgency of addressing climate change, many governments struggle to implement effective policies due to competing economic interests, short-term political cycles, and public skepticism. This disconnect often leads to insufficient funding for renewable energy projects, inadequate regulations on emissions, and a lack of commitment to international agreements.

Furthermore, the influence of fossil fuel industries can hinder progress by lobbying against climate initiatives and promoting misinformation. This creates a challenging environment for advocates pushing for transformative change. Additionally, there is a need for greater public awareness and engagement; many individuals feel overwhelmed or powerless in the face of such a vast issue, which can stifle grassroots movements.

To overcome these challenges, it is essential to foster collaboration between governments, businesses, and communities. Building coalitions that prioritize sustainability can help create a unified front for climate action. Education and awareness campaigns can also empower individuals to take action in their own lives, making climate change a more relatable issue.

While global understanding of climate change has grown, individuals, businesses, and governments often struggle to implement sustainable solutions due to financial constraints, limited infrastructure, or competing priorities. In developing regions, these challenges are compounded by poverty, weak waste management systems, and limited access to clean technologies, making sustainable choices difficult to adopt.

Accessibility of climate innovations is another barrier. Solutions like renewable energy, sustainable materials, or circular economy models exist but often remain out of reach for communities that need them most. Without supportive policies, incentives, and education, these technologies fail to scale and reach those most affected by environmental degradation.

Cultural attitudes and habitual consumption also hinder progress. Even with awareness of plastic pollution, deforestation, or carbon emissions, behavior change is difficult without practical alternatives, ongoing engagement, and community support.

For many coastal villages where I work, climate action competes with basic survival, food security, income, and livelihoods. Asking a fisher not to fish in a depleted reef is very different when that reef is his only source of daily income. This makes climate action deeply tied to social justice. Another challenge is communication. Scientific knowledge often stays in reports and institutions instead of reaching the people who need it most in a form they can understand and act upon. This is why I became passionate about using data, storytelling, and community engagement to bridge this gap.

In my country, we are very good at planning but very bad at executing.
Aside from corruption and weak enforcements, the budget allocated for climate action goes mainly to response, but very few for prevention. Poor families and vulnerable communities affected by extreme calamities and unpredictable weather are left on our own and have no choice but to do unsustainable practices to prioritize survival.
The real challenge really lies on the efficiency and dedication of our leaders, with consistency and honesty before another calamity hits us.

1341,"

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the lack of awareness about how environmental problems directly affect daily life. I learned this while rearing fish at home in Yaba, Lagos. The water available had to be chemically treated just to keep the fish alive. That simple experience made me realize how unsafe water and unmanaged waste threaten human health. It�s easy to discuss climate change in abstract terms, but few people see how it impacts their immediate surroundings until it affects them personally.

Another challenge is the absence of practical, low-cost solutions for communities. In Yaba, drainage is often blocked, waste is scattered in streets, and clean water is limited. People want to act, but there are few accessible ways to make lasting improvements.

Bridging this gap requires solutions that are directly relevant to local realities, like monitoring water quality or managing waste in ways communities can implement without relying on large-scale infrastructure. My experience has shown that meaningful climate action must start with simple, observable interventions that people can adopt and maintain, because only then can awareness translate into real impact.

While global commitments continue to increase, communities most affected by climate shocks still lack adequate financing, technology and institutional capacity to adapt. This results in recurrent vulnerabilities, drought-driven hunger, loss of livelihoods, displacement and overstretched social protection systems.

Another key challenge is the limited integration of data and monitoring systems in climate initiatives. Many interventions lack actionable evidence, making it difficult to track progress, target resources correctly or measure resilience outcomes. Without strong data systems, even well-intended climate actions risk being ineffective.
Additionally, climate action remains disconnected from the priorities of young people, who are both the most affected and the least represented in decision-making spaces. Youth engagement is often symbolic rather than structural, leaving young leaders without the support or platforms needed to drive meaningful change.
Finally, climate justice remains a persistent challenge. The communities least responsible for emissions bear the heaviest consequences, yet international financing mechanisms remain slow, bureaucratic and insufficient.

The real challenge is to build adaptation plans that connect all sectors, value local knowledge, and mobilize simple, accessible solutions rooted in people�s daily lives. As long as climate action remains sector-based, it cannot address the complexity of the realities communities face.

Social and economic inequality also plays a critical role. Coastal communities, rural populations, and women often face higher risks and have limited access to resources, technology, and information. Without equitable access, climate efforts remain insufficient and unjust.

Additionally, resistance to changing habits, at both individual and corporate levels, slows progress. Unsustainable practices persist due to limited alternatives or lack of awareness.

1356,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today has two main aspects. First, we need to phase out fossil fuels effectively. Second, we must ensure that the energy transition doesn�t create new social or environmental harms, especially through the extraction of critical minerals.

Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas still dominate the global energy system, and burning them is the main source of greenhouse-gas emissions. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need a fast, fair, and well-supported shift away from fossil fuels, including moving financial flows out of these industries.

At the same time, transitioning to renewable energy depends on minerals such as lithium, copper, nickel, and cobalt. Without proper safeguards, mining these resources can cause environmental damage, biodiversity loss, pollution, and human-rights violations, particularly affecting Indigenous and local communities.

The real challenge is not just replacing fossil fuels with renewables but ensuring a just energy transition without repeating patterns of exploitation or harm.

1357,"The foremost challenge for climate action today is the disparity between global climate policies and the realities of the Global South and particularly the Middle East. Everywhere else, the impacts of climate change affect vulnerable, rural and Indigenous populations the most and while there may be scientific solutions, they affect those populations the most and rarely reach them. This divide, accompanied by slow climate finance, poor governance, and unequal political power, undermines effective climate action.  

In the Middle East, climate change impacts and governance are intertwined. Water scarcity, extreme heat, and land degradation result in climate change exacerbating the pressure on already poor and fragile socio-economic systems and threaten peoples' livelihoods. With decreasing resources, rested tensions are likely to rise. This makes climate change a challenge to peace and security as well as the environment.  

The narrative dominance of the Global North also contributes to this challenge and barriers to climate action. Indigenous and community-led practices are oftentimes overlooked.

The way forward now is not only mitigation, but preparing societies (especially those on the frontlines of the climate crisis who hold deep, place-based knowledge) to survive, adapt, and carry forward the wisdom that has sustained them for generations.
A major barrier is the widening divide between policymakers and the communities living on the frontlines of climate impacts. Too often, climate strategies are shaped by political agendas rather than community needs, resulting in policies that are underfunded, unrealistic, or inaccessible to the people they are meant to protect. At the EU and global level, where transparency and inclusive decision-making are expected, bridging this gap is urgent. Communities must be meaningfully included in co-developing the policies that will directly affect their lands, livelihoods, and rights.
Another challenge is that scientific data remain distant from practitioners working on the ground, leading in some cases to maladaptation.

For example, COP15 in Copenhagen (2009) was expected to deliver a binding global treaty but collapsed into a weak political agreement due to divisions between developed and developing nations.

1376,"I believe that the greatest challenge for climate action today is to understand, in an integrated way, the relationship between different systems and how events or decisions in a specific context can generate consequences at multiple scales. Often, this complexity creates uncertainty about where to begin and which adaptation actions to prioritize.
For example, a negative environmental intervention in one country can trigger significant impacts in other regions, rendering previously established policies or strategies insufficient. In these cases, governments and communities need to redefine goals, develop new methods, and mobilize social efforts to respond to effects that transcend borders and directly affect local populations and ecosystems.
Furthermore, the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme events associated with climate change make it difficult to predict how and when different territories will be affected. This unpredictability compromises the ability to plan adequate responses and, consequently, hinders the promotion of climate justice among regions with distinct vulnerabilities and capacities.
Therefore, the central challenge lies in dealing with the systemic complexity of climate change, its transnational dynamics, and the need for continuous adaptation, especially in contexts where there are structural inequalities and resource limitations.",0.507329,0.43125838,0.6490871,0.7042383016982521,#f3a134

While countries like Senegal are facing immediate challenges such as coastal erosion, declining fisheries, and water scarcity, they often lack the financial resources and technological support needed to adapt effectively.

At the same time, major emitters are not reducing emissions fast enough, which widens the injustice. This imbalance creates frustration and slows down global progress. Another part of the challenge is that climate action is still too often treated as separate from economic and social priorities, instead of being integrated into development, job creation, and community resilience.

To move forward, we need stronger international cooperation, fair climate finance, and policies that place vulnerable communities at the center. Youth voices must also be included, because young people�not just globally, but especially in regions like West Africa�are experiencing the consequences most directly and have innovative ideas that can drive real change.",0.57393646,0.40467596,0.89670706,0.7547162649960562,#f3a134
1378,"The significant challenge is the reliance on fossil fuels, which remains deeply embedded in global economies. Transitioning to renewable energy sources requires substantial investment and infrastructure changes, which can be met with resistance from industries reliant on fossil fuels. Moreover, many countries face competing priorities such as economic growth and development, which can overshadow climate considerations.

Public awareness and engagement also present challenges. A considerable portion of the population may not fully understand the implications of climate change or may feel powerless to make an impact. This can lead to apathy or disillusionment regarding individual actions and policy advocacy.

Lastly, the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events and rising sea levels, disproportionately affect vulnerable communities, often exacerbating social inequalities. Addressing these disparities is crucial for effective climate action, as it requires a holistic approach that considers both environmental and social justice.

A smallholder farmer facing drought isn't helped by a distant carbon neutrality target.They need access to affordable drought resistant seeds and training in water harvesting techniques now. This gap is fueled by a lack of context-specific solutions and inadequate financing mechanisms that bypass the very communities like youth-led agri-businesses who are pivotal for building resilience.

Bridging this gap requires hyper localized strategies that translate global goals into practical, economically viable tools for communities.

1384,"Here are Some of the Biggest Challenge of Climate Action Today;

The biggest challenge of climate action today is transforming awareness into meaningful, sustained action. Despite growing understanding of climate change and its consequences, progress is often slowed by limited political will, insufficient funding, and short-term economic priorities that undermine long-term sustainability. Policies exist but are frequently weakened by poor enforcement and lack of accountability.

Inequality amplifies the problem. Vulnerable communities, which contribute least to climate change, bear the heaviest impacts and often lack the resources, knowledge, or infrastructure to adapt. This makes it difficult to implement inclusive strategies that benefit those who need solutions most.

Misinformation, low public engagement, and resistance to behavioral change further hinder collective action. Fragmented efforts among governments, private sectors, and communities reduce the overall impact of climate initiatives.

Overcoming these challenges requires strong leadership, innovative and well-funded solutions, and community-driven approaches that turn awareness into action. Climate strategies must balance environmental protection with social and economic development, ensuring resilience, equity, and sustainability. Closing the gap between knowledge and implementation is crucial for achieving real, lasting progress in addressing the global climate crisis.

1385,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening gap between the urgency of adaptation and the institutions and finance needed to support it. Climate impacts are already disrupting economies and communities, yet global systems remain structured around mitigation first, adaptation second.

COP30 made this imbalance clear. The summit elevated adaptation as a priority and called for tripling adaptation finance, but the target year of 2035 and the absence of strong enforcement mechanisms showed how slowly the world is moving relative to the scale of current risks. Negotiators also acknowledged that existing finance is difficult to access, fragmented across institutions, and inadequate for the scale of climate impacts already unfolding.

The deeper issue is structural. Many countries lack the planning capacity, data systems, and governance frameworks needed to translate climate risks into bankable, resilience-focused projects. Without stronger institutions and faster, more predictable finance, adaptation remains aspirational rather than actionable.

The core challenge, highlighted at COP30, is turning adaptation from a political commitment into a fully resourced and implementable pillar of global climate action.",0.83308864,0.533222,0.77269673,0.7309965743880623,#f3a134
1386,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is mobilising enough and adequate finance, especially in developing countries.

Eswatini alone will require between $2.4 billion and $3 billion by 2035 to meet its carbon reduction goal of 2.24 million tonnes. The funding gap, along with limited institutional capacity and underdeveloped private-sector participation, hinders the realisation of climate-resilient projects and the adoption of renewable energy.

My experience in climate-resilient projects and public-private partnerships has demonstrated that innovative financing, such as green bonds, blended finance, and strategic loans, is crucial to bridging this gap. Sustainable finance allows governments and private actors to invest in climate-smart infrastructure, delivering both social and financial returns. The challenge is not only in raising capital but also in structuring it to encourage long-term, measurable impacts while ensuring accessibility for vulnerable communities.

Tackling this challenge demands skilled professionals who can integrate finance, governance, and sustainability.

Many of the communities experiencing the harshest effects of rising temperatures, unreliable energy systems, desertification, and flooding have the least influence on global climate decisions and the lowest access to climate-resilient technologies. This disconnect creates policies and solutions that often do not match local realities, are too expensive, or fail to reach the people who need them most.

In my work across several African markets, I have seen that adoption of clean technologies is not held back by lack of interest, but by affordability, limited financing, and infrastructure gaps. For example, electric mobility can dramatically reduce emissions and daily fuel costs, yet many low-income workers cannot access these products without tailored financing models. Similarly, device circularity and repair systems can significantly cut e-waste, but they require supportive policies, incentives, and market structures that do not yet exist at scale in many Global South countries.

Addressing climate change requires more than technology. It requires empowering communities, bridging the policy-to-reality gap, and creating financing and regulatory systems that make sustainable choices the most accessible choices.",0.52006245,0.6330977,0.5745374,0.7073746474406772,#f3a134

Another major challenge is that climate change is often seen as a �future problem,� especially in developing countries where people prioritize daily survival over long-term environmental issues. This creates a situation where climate action is not integrated into everyday decision-making, government planning, or business operations. As a result, policies take too long to implement, and existing environmental protections are not properly enforced.

First, political will is inconsistent. Short-term political interests, frequent leadership changes, and competing economic priorities often delay long-term climate strategies. Second, climate financing is insufficient and unevenly distributed. Developing countries, which are the most vulnerable to climate impacts, lack the resources and technology needed to transition to clean energy and build climate resilience.
Third, misinformation and low public awareness continue to hinder collective action. Many communities still underestimate the severity of climate risks or lack access to clear, science-based information. Fourth, youth and marginalized groups are often excluded from climate decision-making, limiting the diversity of ideas needed for innovative solutions.

1407,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between climate commitments and effective implementation. Globally, policies and agreements exist, but they often fail to translate into real, lasting change due to weak institutions, insufficient funding, and lack of political will.
 In Nigeria, this gap is particularly visible  as communities face frequent flooding, poor waste management, deforestation, and unsustainable agricultural practices, all of which directly threaten health, livelihoods, and the environment. Local youth and community advocates try to fill these gaps through awareness campaigns and grassroots initiatives, but without strong institutional support, their efforts cannot scale or endure. This challenge also reflects a broader global issue: vulnerable populations, especially in the Global South, often bear the heaviest climate impacts while having the least influence in policymaking. Strengthening the implementation of climate policies, ensuring they reach the communities most affected is essential for meaningful and equitable climate action worldwide.

The challenge is not just enforcing regulations but also addressing the socio-economic realities that drive them. Many people depend on it for their livelihoods, making it difficult to implement sustainable alternatives without viable economic opportunities. This illustrates a broader climate challenge of achieving meaningful action requires solutions that are both environmentally effective and socially equitable.
This issue demands integrated strategies, such as sustainable resource management, reforestation, renewable energy adoption and circular economy initiatives which can restore ecosystems while providing alternative livelihoods.

1440,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is closing the gap between awareness and real implementation. Many people understand the urgency of climate change, yet translating that understanding into consistent, large-scale action remains difficult. This gap is driven by several interconnected barriers.

Short-term political and economic pressures often overshadow long-term climate priorities. Even when strong policies exist, they can be delayed or weakened by competing interests. At the same time, climate impacts are deeply unequal: communities with the fewest resources face the greatest risks but have the least access to funding, technology, and decision-making power. This inequity slows collective progress.

Misinformation and polarization add another layer of difficulty. When climate science becomes politicized or distorted, it becomes harder for communities to trust information, support policies, or work together.

Finally, the scale of the problem can feel overwhelming. Individuals may want to act but lack guidance, while institutions struggle to coordinate complex systems like energy, transportation, and land use.

To overcome these challenges, we need solutions that center equity, improve public understanding, and make climate action feel achievable and beneficial in everyday life.

This challenge manifests itself in two main ways, both of which are directly relevant to a program such as the Young Climate Leaders - Ideas Lab:
1. Justice and Equity in the Transition
The challenge is not only technical, but also social and economic. Ensuring a just transition is paramount.
2. Inequality: The impact of the climate crisis hits hardest those communities that have contributed least to it. Climate finance promised by developed countries remains largely insufficient and often takes the form of loans rather than grants.
Despite our lofty promises and sense of urgency, the reality of action on the ground is often that of an obstacle course:
The Isolated Actor Syndrome: We have the solutions, but they face rigid institutional barriers and isolation. Local actors struggle alone, without the mentoring and co-creation necessary to truly multiply their impact.
The Adaptation Time Trial: Time is running out�science demands maximum speed of execution�but the complexity of procedures slows us down.

Climate solutions require substantial upfront investment, but wealthy nations and private institutions often fail to deliver sufficient funds, and access to them is slow and bureaucratic.
The financial resources provided are far below what is needed, and vulnerable countries that contribute the least to global emissions are left with the greatest burden of climate impacts. This financial gap also restricts the scaling up of promising solutions, such as climate-smart irrigation and affordable solar power.

One major barrier is the unequal distribution of climate impacts, where vulnerable communities, especially Indigenous populations, mountain regions, and the Global South, face the harshest consequences despite contributing the least to the crisis. Yet these groups often have the least influence in policy spaces. 

Another challenge is the dominance of short-term economic interests over long-term ecological well-being. Governments and corporations frequently prioritise growth, resource extraction, and infrastructural expansion even in fragile ecosystems. This leads to inadequate adaptation efforts and weakened environmental regulations.

A third challenge is the lack of integration of Indigenous and local knowledge into formal climate strategies. Communities have long-standing resilience practices, but their knowledge is undervalued or ignored in favour of external �expert-driven� solutions.

Across many communities, young climate advocates are eager to create real impact, yet they are consistently held back by limited access to reliable information, technical resources, funding opportunities, and global networks that could amplify their voice.

For many youths, climate action still feels like something happening �out there,� in distant conferences or high-level rooms they cannot enter. Without the right knowledge, mentorship, or platforms to collaborate, even the most brilliant ideas struggle to grow beyond intention. And when funding barriers are added to the mix, young people are forced to shrink their visions simply because the resources needed to scale them are out of reach.

This gap does not mean youths are silent, it means they are under-supported. They have the energy, creativity, and boldness to drive transformative solutions, but climate action cannot thrive on passion alone. It needs systems that equip young people with the tools to understand the issues deeply, build solutions confidently, and connect their local actions to global movements.

For example, farmers in my area know the weather is changing, but the support system they need�better seeds, early warning systems, soil solutions, financial help�is not strong enough.

I also think that climate action becomes difficult because people get tired. Climate change feels too big, too fast, and sometimes hopeless. This creates frustration and inaction.

While it is true that countries need to develop and industries, particularly in Africa, must grow, we cannot prioritize development at the expense of addressing climate change.

Climate action should be a shared responsibility. Individuals need to understand that their daily choices, such as how they generate energy, use resources, and consume products, impact the climate. Awareness efforts must extend beyond government meetings, conferences, and research institutions to reach all levels of society, from those involved in charcoal production to students in schools.

I am confident that combating climate change is achievable, as many solutions are available.

To fix this, we need governance that mandates and funds joint work. That means shared risk assessments, interoperable data, joint targets, and co -produced plans with communities. It also means platforms that integrate meteorological, environmental, veterinary, and human health surveillance for early warning, as well as training and roles for people who can translate across disciplines. Accountability should track co benefits and climate and health outcomes and not only sector outputs.

1471,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is getting individuals and communities to adopt climate-conscious behaviours in their daily lives. While climate advocates have tried to create awareness about climate change, and while more people understand the climate crisis, this knowledge does not always translate into everyday decisions that support sustainability.
Climate awareness does not always translate into real behavioural change. One major reason is that climate messaging often feels too technical, too distant, or not connected to the everyday realities people face. When climate communication focuses on global statistics instead of relatable, day-to-day experiences, people struggle to see their role or understand how their choices matter. This gap makes it harder to influence actual meaningful behaviour change towards sustainable practices and can leave room for misinformation or indifference.
Also, many developing countries face barriers such as limited access to clean energy, weak waste management systems, and the high cost of eco-friendly alternatives. This makes it difficult for people to make climate conscious choices. Another challenge is accountability. Government and organizations make commitments without transparency or the leadership resolve to implement them. This can hinder progress when it comes to climate action. 
Therefore, the challenge for climate action is the difficulty of turning climate awareness and knowledge into consistent collective action.",0.42926812,0.1294576,0.37350583,0.7822022549657758,#f3a134

Another major challenge is that climate solutions often overlook social justice. Communities facing poverty, food insecurity or limited energy access are expected to adapt without receiving sufficient support. At the same time, misinformation and lack of climate education make it harder for the public to understand the urgency of taking action.

Many frameworks regulating global supply chains, investment protection, and corporate behaviour were built to prioritise capital stability, often shielding high-emitting sectors and limiting states� regulatory space. This structural imbalance delays ambitious mitigation and deepens global inequalities.
A second challenge is the narrow, technocratic framing of the climate crisis. Climate action is too often approached only through engineering or economic solutions, overlooking its social, human rights, and justice dimensions. Such approaches can unintentionally exacerbate vulnerabilities, marginalise communities, or reinforce historical patterns of environmental injustice.
Effective climate action requires centring people. Human rights-based approaches, inclusive governance, and mechanisms that ensure remedy and accountability are essential for a fair transition.

1505,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the disconnect between global urgency and local capacity. While governments, institutions, and individuals increasingly understand the dangers of climate change, many communities, especially in developing regions, lack the resources, technologies, and infrastructure needed to implement solutions effectively.
Another major barrier is the fragmentation of efforts. Climate action requires strong collaboration across governments, private sectors, research institutions, and communities. However, policies are often slow, funding is limited, and innovative local initiatives struggle to scale without coordinated support. This slows down the transition from ideas to measurable impact.
In many regions, climate solutions also compete with urgent social needs such as education, healthcare, and employment. As a result, environmental issues are often seen as secondary, even though they are deeply connected to daily life, public health, and economic development.

Climate solutions often require long-term investment, structural changes, and policies that may seem costly or politically difficult in the short term. As a result, action is delayed, inconsistent, or too small to match the urgency of the crisis.

This lack of political and economic will also reinforces other barriers: communities most affected by climate change are excluded from decision-making, misinformation spreads easily, and individuals feel powerless. When leadership hesitates, the entire system slows down.

1507,"Growing up in a rural agricultural community in Ghana, I have worked closely with smallholder farmers through the 'Gongon' Adaptation Initiative. This has made me very aware of the real impact of climate change on people. Over the past eight years, I have witnessed how unpredictable rainfall and long droughts put livelihoods at risk. Local efforts to adapt have become about survival rather than just an option.

This firsthand experience has strengthened my belief that the main barrier to effective climate action is not technology but rather deep socio-political problems. There is a lack of unified political will and international cooperation, made worse by issues of equity and justice.

While we teach farmers adaptation techniques, our local initiatives often seem small compared to the global scale of the crisis. The technologies needed for a sustainable transition exist, but their use is blocked by political shortsightedness and the ""free-rider"" problem. Countries are reluctant to act because they worry about economic consequences. This situation is deeply unjust. Communities like mine in Ghana, which have contributed the least to past emissions, are the most vulnerable. 

In the end, this is a challenge of collective action. Without strong political agreement and a truly fair framework that supports those most at risk, even the best solutions will struggle to grow and work quickly enough.

In Guinea-Bissau, many of these communities depend directly on agriculture, fishing, and natural resources for their daily livelihoods. Climate change impacts, such as rising temperatures, irregular rainfall, and coastal erosion, disproportionately affect these populations, who often lack access to technologies, infrastructure, and knowledge to adapt effectively. Another critical challenge is the lack of inclusion of local voices in climate policies. Decisions about environmental management and mitigation projects are often made without considering the experiences and needs of rural and marginalized communities, including women, youth, and people with disabilities. This reduces the effectiveness of interventions and increases vulnerability. Limited funding and capacity-building further restrict local initiatives, making it difficult to implement practical, low-cost solutions, such as water sanitation, resilient agricultural practices, or participatory coastal management.Addressing climate challenges in Guinea-Bissau requires an inclusive and participatory approach, combining context-sensitive public policies, knowledge transfer, and community empowerment.

Though governments publicly pledge climate ambitions, actual improvement is usually limited by scarce funding, poor institutional capacity, uneven access to technology, and other competing socio-economic pressures overall.

To most of the Global South countries, the issue of climate action is trumped by harsh realities like unemployment, inequality, poverty, and energy insecurity. This leads to well-conceived climate policies in word, but draggy or lump-sum in action. This scarcity of significant global climate finance, specifically predictable, accessible, and grant-based funding, renders the implementation of the adaptation and mitigation measures of a large scale extremely challenging to the countries.

The second critical issue is that the youth, grassroots and the vulnerable groups are not involved in decision making. Still, climate policy is surrounded by elite voices as they leave out the voices of those that are disproportionately affected by climate impacts. Inclusive governance means that without this, the solutions may be invalid or unfair.

Lastly, it seems to be a begone communication issue: climate science and policy are commonly introduced to the audience in complex and incomprehensible forms, and people have trouble trying to grasp it and get involved.

At the same time, the exciting innovations I learn about in school rarely reach the communities that need them most. It often feels like the solutions are created far away, but never adapted to our realities.

Another major challenge is the disconnect between what governments plan and what local people actually face.

When Donald Trump came into power, he cut funding to the US Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy and the Interior and withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Likewise, talk has been rife of Europe backsliding on climate with the rise of right-wing and isolationism in countries like Finland, Sweden and Belgium. All of these developments create the impression that global climate ambition is eroding.

Although climate policy is being strongly contested in Europe and America at unprecedented levels, the Climate Policy Hub at Oxford University shows that new and strengthened climate policies can be found across the world, especially in Asia and emerging markets. Many countries, including my own, continue to promote climate policies and legislation, develop renewable energy industries, and integrate long-term decarbonisation strategies. However, due to the backsliding of a minority of nations, albeit wealthy nations, there is a growing perception that climate action is no longer the agenda of our time. This decreases action and commitment.

Because of this, climate action becomes something distant, even though we are already seeing the effects.

Another challenge is lack of support and resources. Even when people want to manage waste properly or protect their environment, there are no effective systems to help them. Young people also have ideas but limited opportunities to turn them into real action.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and meaningful action. Globally, there is no longer a shortage of information about climate change�scientists, policymakers, and the public largely understand the risks. However, translating this awareness into sustained political will, strong policies, and large-scale behavior change remains difficult. Short-term economic interests often outweigh long-term environmental priorities, leading to delays in implementing bold climate solutions.

Another major challenge is inequality. Communities that contribute the least to climate change are often the most vulnerable to its impacts, yet they have the fewest resources to adapt or recover. This imbalance creates tension in global negotiations, as developing nations struggle to balance development needs with environmental responsibility.

Additionally, misinformation and public skepticism continue to slow progress. When people question the reality or urgency of climate change, it weakens collective responsibility and reduces support for necessary policies.

First, climate action often competes with more immediate social and economic pressures, especially in communities facing poverty, unemployment, or limited access to resources. When daily survival is a struggle, long-term environmental concerns can seem less urgent.

Second, there is a lack of adequate funding and political will. Governments may make commitments, but implementation is slow due to limited budgets, competing priorities, or weak enforcement of environmental policies. This is made worse by global inequalities�countries most affected by climate change are often the least equipped to respond to it.

Third, climate misinformation and low public engagement create barriers to collective action.

This means emissions in the Global South are expected to increase in the coming decades unless the shift to re-newable technologies happens at a scale and speed far beyond what current support systems allow.

But the transition is not just a technological or financial challenge; it is also a behavioral one. Convincing people to reduce overconsumption is becoming extremely difficult. Many communities are experiencing material comfort for the first time, and it is hard to ask them to consume less. On a finite planet, the consumption must be finite.

1534,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening gap between global policy commitments and the lived realities of vulnerable communities, particularly in the Global South. While countries increasingly commit to adaptation and resilience frameworks, local systems often lack the financing, data, and institutional capacity needed to operationalise these commitments effectively.
In the WASH sector, this challenge is especially visible. Climate change disrupts water availability, increases disease outbreaks, damages infrastructure, and exposes deep inequalities in access to safe water and sanitation. Yet many affected communities still operate without strong early-warning systems, resilient infrastructure, or inclusive climate governance structures. This disconnect limits the effectiveness of climate action, even when political commitments exist.
A second dimension of the challenge is that climate action remains highly fragmented sectors like health, water, environment, planning, and disaster management often work in silos. Effective adaptation requires integrated approaches. Without this intersectional approach, interventions remain short-term and fail to address systemic vulnerabilities.
Finally, climate finance is still inaccessible to many local governments due to stringent requirements, limited technical support, and slow disbursement mechanisms. This delays critical adaptation measures in the communities that need them most.",0.8010423,0.49954647,0.87197185,0.7055352781545435,#f3a134
1535,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the disconnect between environmental data and the everyday decisions communities, businesses, and governments make. Climate change is often discussed globally, but the real battle is lost at the local level�where people don�t see how ecosystem changes affect their food, income, or health.
From my work studying pollen in honey, I�ve observed how subtle ecological shifts�declining plant diversity, stressed bee populations, contaminated landscapes�signal much larger climate threats. Yet these early warnings rarely reach policymakers or the public. Data exists, but the translation into clear, actionable insight is missing.
This gap causes three main issues:
1.	Low urgency: When climate impacts aren�t visible or relatable, communities prioritize immediate economic needs over environmental action.
2.	Weak policy: Policies often lack integration of local scientific evidence and fail to address real vulnerabilities.
3.	Fragmented accountability: Without understanding how climate degradation links to food safety and livelihoods, harmful practices like adulterated food or poor land management continue unchecked.
The core challenge is not just climate change but the gap between knowledge and behavior. Bridging this means empowering young scientists and community leaders to translate data into trusted, practical decisions. Narrowing this gap turns climate action into a community-driven movement, beyond just policy talk.

1536,"First, the public conventional mindset and habitual behavior. Many people keep following old practices even when these harm the climate. They stay attached to familiar habits. A community may face losses, yet people do not shift to climate-friendly options. The reason is simple. They do not see a direct and immediate impact. This slows the adoption of safer and sustainable approaches. Thus, people avoid shared responsibility. They overlook small daily impacts that shape emissions and resource use. This limits long-term action and slows community-level change.
Second, sector gaps and isolated decision-making. Policies follow a top down model that reduces coordination across water, agriculture, health, energy, and local government. Quick fixes target one issue but ignore cross-sector effects. For example, raising an embankment may prevent flooding in one area but trap water in nearby farmland, create waterlogging, reduce yield, and increase disease risk. This type of planning weakens SDG progress.
Third, weak innovation ecosystem and limited local grounding. Policymakers often stay disconnected from community realities. Locally led adaptation receives low support. Indigenous knowledge gets minimal funding. Many regions lack baseline data and research capacity. This restricts nature-based solutions and slows evidence-driven innovation. These three barriers reduce the scale and impact of climate action.

While international agreements set ambitious targets, many vulnerable communities, especially in the Global South, lack the resources, technical capacity, and governance needed to adapt effectively. Extreme events like floods, droughts, and heatwaves hit these populations hardest.
Another key challenge is climate justice. Marginalized groups, including women, youth, and displaced people, are disproportionately affected yet often excluded from decision-making. Without inclusive policies, climate solutions risk reinforcing existing inequalities.
Finally, limited awareness and engagement hinder collective action. Strengthening climate education, youth involvement, and community-led initiatives is essential.

While international agreements set ambitious targets, translating them into context specific, practical solutions remains challenging. Communities facing climate driven food insecurity, water scarcity, and urban vulnerabilities often lack the knowledge, infrastructure, and resources to implement sustainable solutions.

This gap is especially visible in climate-sensitive regions like the Himalayas, where fragile ecosystems and steep terrain magnify climate risks. Even when climate awareness exists, institutions often lack climate data, early warning systems, or trained personnel to implement adaptation measures.

Another challenge is that adaptation efforts are often fragmented, with disaster management, WASH, urban planning, and environmental protection working separately instead of through integrated climate resilience planning.

Finally, young people are rarely given roles in shaping local adaptation strategies, even though they are key to long-term climate solutions. Strengthening local institutions, improving climate risk training, integrating sectors, and empowering youth leadership are essential to overcoming these barriers and accelerating climate adaptation where it is needed most.

Although international agreements establish essential objectives, they frequently overlook the particular social, economic, and cultural contexts in which implementation needs to take place.
Through my interactions with agricultural and pastoral communities, I observed how government policies, despite being well-meaning, can unintentionally disrupt local economies and traditional parctices. This generates opposition and hinders advancement. For example, reforestation initiatives that ban grazing without providing alternatives overlook centuries of pastoral knowledge and jeopardize economic viability.
The real difficulty lies in creating connections. We require methods that attentively engage with local needs, appreciate traditional wisdom, and collaboratively develop solutions that communities truly endorse.

1540,"For me, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between knowing and doing. Many people are aware that climate change is happening, but turning that awareness into real, consistent action is still very difficult. In many communities, especially those facing poverty, people are focused on day-to-day survival. When someone is worried about food, income, or schooling, it becomes hard for them to prioritize environmental issues, even though climate change affects all of these things.

Another challenge is that people often don�t fully understand how climate change connects to their daily lives. Without clear, simple information, it�s easy for climate issues to feel distant or �not my problem.� This makes it harder to get communities involved in activities like tree planting, proper waste disposal, or protecting natural resources.

Youth involvement is also limited. Young people have the energy and ideas, but they�re rarely included where big climate decisions are made. That means many solutions never get the support they need to grow.

Overall, I believe the real challenge is not a lack of passion or ideas�it�s the lack of support, communication, and opportunities that help people turn climate awareness into real action.

The real challenge is not the absence of solutions but the unequal distribution of power to define what climate action should look like. This creates a cycle where climate action is imposed rather than co-created, forcing many Global South communities to redefine resilience on their own terms: having agency, demanding accountability, and shaping their own pathways to adaptation and mitigation. We must take inspiration in that and rally for climate action that is rooted in lived experiences, cultural contexts, and local priorities. It must not be a one-size-fits-all model that ignores diversity and historical injustices.

For many countries in the Global South, climate impacts are accelerating faster than the support they receive. Climate finance remains insufficient, slow to access, and heavily shaped by donor priorities rather than local needs. This deepens inequalities and limits the ability of frontline communities to build resilience.

Another major barrier is access to adaptation finance. While significant funding exists globally, very little reaches frontline communities in a form they can use. Complex application processes, stringent requirements, and limited support systems make it difficult for grassroots institutions and conservancies to tap into climate finance, even though they are already implementing effective nature-based and resilience solutions.

At the same time, countries in the Global South are the most affected by climate change but often have the least resources to fight it.

This creates an unfair situation where those who are least responsible for the crisis are suffering the most.

Another challenge is getting everyone on board. Many people still don�t see climate change as an urgent issue, so there�s not enough pressure to push for the necessary changes. This makes it hard to move forward with real solutions.

There has also been the impact of drought on the agricultural sector. This has led to decreased biosecurity and decreased food security. The farmers have to spend more to keep their crops healthy and nutritious for the market, this has an immediate impact on who can afford food. This is a phenomenon I see daily in my province of the North West. Weather events like la ni�a and el ni�o have very devastating effects on local farmers, small scale farmers and general infrastructure. Political will is supposed to identify that this is a growing problem and needs to be addressed as urgently as unemployment and inequality.

1564,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the lack of political will and coordinated global action. While the science is clear and solutions exist, meaningful progress is often stalled because short-term economic interests and national priorities take precedence over long-term environmental needs. Many governments struggle to enforce climate policies or commit to ambitious targets, and global cooperation is complicated by differing levels of development and resources among countries.
This challenge is made even harder by our continued dependence on fossil fuels, industrial emissions, and unsustainable consumption habits. Technologies and strategies to reduce emissions are available, but transitioning entire economies requires strong leadership, consistent policies, and collaboration across nations�things that are often missing. Individual efforts and community initiatives are important, but without support from governments and institutions, their impact remains limited.
Addressing this challenge requires more than technical solutions; it demands systemic change in how decisions are made and priorities are set. Strong international agreements, clear accountability, and climate-conscious economic planning are essential.

Developing nations require $310-400 billion annually by 2035 for resilience, yet current flows stand at around $46 billion, exacerbated by debt burdens�many African countries spend more on interest than health or education�political instability under juntas, and donor hesitancy. This shortfall hampers frontline efforts like agroecology and renewable energy, despite Africa's low emissions (4% globally).??

From my experience as a CONAJEC Youth Delegate in UNFCCC talks and Study Officer piloting carbon-certified projects, this gap undermines mitigation too: without adaptation funding, communities can't shift to sustainable agriculture or energy, stalling NDC implementation where Africa gets just 23% of required finance. Coal phase-out lags globally (needing 10x faster decline), but for the Sahel, adaptation is existential�prioritizing security over policy fragments progress.??

Their lives are changing: their customs, livelihoods, daily activities, and habits are all being disrupted.

The urgent task now is to acknowledge these changes and work together to build resilience. Climate action cannot be left to governments or scientists alone; it requires collective engagement from everyone�youth, local communities, experts, and leaders alike. It is not just a question of funding or resources; this is about the future of humanity and all life on Earth�humans, animals, plants, and the soils that sustain us.

Addressing this challenge means embracing systemic change, sharing knowledge across borders, and empowering communities to adapt sustainably.

We know what needs to be done, yet the structures of finance, politics, and power still place short-term interests above fairness, community needs, and long-term resilience.

In the Global South, this becomes even more complicated. Countries like Namibia often depend on external financing and investment, which means our climate pathways are heavily influenced by priorities set elsewhere. This can lead to transitions that look green on paper but don�t always strengthen local development or reflect community voices.

Another challenge is that climate action is still too often approached as a technical problem. Solutions focus on technologies and infrastructure, while the human side (participation, justice, local knowledge) is treated as secondary. But without addressing these social dimensions, transitions risk repeating old patterns of inequality.

We have strong international commitments, but the policies, financing, and incentives needed to turn those commitments into practical solutions often don�t reach the communities most affected by climate impacts. In many places, climate change is still experienced as a daily struggle, heat, flooding, food insecurity, pollution etc. but the systems meant to support adaptation or mitigation remain slow, fragmented, or inaccessible.

Another key challenge is that climate solutions are often designed without the people who must implement them. This creates interventions that look good on paper but fail to gain community trust or change behavior. In my work, I have seen that people want to act on climate, but they need clear benefits/incentives, supportive governance, and culturally-relevant tools.

Finally, financing remains a major barrier. Small, community-driven projects that deliver real on-ground impact, like waste diversion, circular economy initiatives, and youth-led and green climate solutions heavily struggle to access predictable funding, while large-scale emitters still benefit from subsidies.

In Asia today, floods affect homes, schools, and jobs, especially in rural areas or floating villages. People want to take action to protect the environment or reduce climate change, but they often face challenges like limited resources, lack of knowledge, and difficulties organizing community projects.  
Another challenge is that climate action requires everyone to work together; consistently small efforts by individuals or communities may not have a big impact unless they are supported and combined with others' actions.

1572,"
The biggest challenge for climate action today is the combination of political inertia and economic dependence on fossil fuels. Despite widespread recognition of climate change as an urgent global threat, meaningful action is often delayed due to conflicting interests among governments, corporations, and communities. Many countries rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy, jobs, and economic growth, making the transition to renewable energy politically sensitive and economically complex. This reliance creates resistance to policies that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, even when long-term benefits clearly outweigh short-term costs.

Another significant challenge is the lack of global coordination. Climate change is a global problem, but nations differ in their responsibilities, capabilities, and priorities. Developing countries, which are often the most vulnerable, may lack the resources to implement sustainable solutions, while wealthier nations sometimes fail to provide adequate support or take strong enough action themselves. This imbalance slows progress and exacerbates inequality.

Additionally, public awareness and engagement remain inconsistent. While climate activism has grown, many individuals and communities still struggle to understand their role in the larger system, limiting grassroots pressure for change. Misinformation and political polarization further complicate efforts to build consensus on climate policies.

Another major difficulty is unequal capacity. Wealthier regions have better access to finance, technology, and skilled labor, while many developing countries struggle with limited resources and competing social needs. Communities facing unemployment, weak infrastructure, or poor social protection find it hard to prioritize climate measures unless they clearly improve daily life. Without support, climate action can feel distant or unfair.

Communication is also a challenge. Technical language and abstract targets often overshadow the human realities of climate change. Workers, farmers, and informal traders need information that connects directly to their livelihoods. When people cannot see themselves in climate discussions, they disengage.

Another major challenge is inequality. Communities that contribute the least to climate change often suffer the most from its impacts, yet they have the least resources to adapt or participate in solutions. Without addressing this imbalance, climate action cannot be fully effective or inclusive.

Misinformation also plays a damaging role. False narratives, low climate literacy, and limited access to reliable information prevent people from making informed choices and supporting strong climate policies.

Finally, young people face barriers such as limited funding, inadequate mentorship, and lack of space in decision-making processes, even though they are among the most active climate advocates.

Additionally, politicians always have short terms in office, (4 -6 years), making it difficult for them to pass policies which may make fossil fuels expensive in the short term or climate friendly policies which may lead to job losses instantly, and achieve clean climate in the long run. Afraid of their approval ratings going down, they prefer maintaining the status quo, preventing any meaningful progress towards green energy. The herding of other countries also makes climate action quite a challenge because they believe that only powerful countries can make significant changes and progress in climate action, without knowing that climate is a resource shared by everyone and no single country can walk the journey alone.

This tension is even sharper in hydrocarbon?dependent states, where political economies and social contracts are tied to oil and gas revenues. If climate action is framed only as rapid decarbonization, without credible pathways for diversification, social protection, and participation, it risks deepening inequality and triggering resistance that slows progress.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between scientific knowledge and large-scale implementation. While research and technology for renewable energy, carbon reduction, and sustainable practices have advanced significantly, many communities, industries, and governments struggle to adopt these solutions due to economic, political, or social barriers. This disconnect slows the transition to a low-carbon future and exacerbates environmental inequalities.

Another major challenge is dependency on fossil fuels. Petrochemical industries remain central to global energy systems, making it difficult to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rapidly without coordinated policy, investment in alternatives, and public buy-in. Many developing countries, in particular, face the dilemma of balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility, which can delay climate-focused initiatives.

Additionally, public awareness and engagement remain uneven. Climate action requires both grassroots participation and systemic change, yet misinformation, limited access to education, and short-term priorities often prevent communities from taking meaningful action.

By connecting scientific research with practical implementation and community empowerment, we can create sustainable systems that reduce emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems, and promote equitable growth. Only through this holistic approach can climate action move from intention to impact.

Key environmental policies are made without including the voices of the territories or the youth, even though we are the ones living in the crisis every day.

This disconnect produces insufficient, technocratic, and unfair policies.

1596,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between climate innovation and climate adoption. Many solutions already exist, but they struggle to scale because policymakers, financiers and industry actors are slow to support alternatives to high-emission systems. In Ghana, the construction sector shows this clearly. Our geopolymer interlocking blocks reduce emissions by up to 80 percent compared to cement and have been tested for durability, safety and affordability. Builders who have used them report lower costs, faster construction and cooler indoor temperatures. Yet financing and government approval channels are almost nonexistent. Large cement suppliers lobby for the status quo, so climate-smart materials remain technically viable but commercially sidelined.

The future of climate action depends on creating systems that allow proven innovations to reach the market. For example, if green building standards were embedded in public housing contracts, or if banks created low-interest financing for low-carbon materials, geopolymer blocks and similar technologies could scale rapidly. Climate action will accelerate when funding mechanisms, procurement rules and political priorities are aligned to reward solutions that reduce emissions and improve resilience rather than reinforce legacy industries.",0.82340646,0.32452637,0.5773747,0.7155142758634598,#f3a134

The error in this thought process is that the climate action they don't want to spend on  will lead them to spend money on the aftermath of some disasters like drought, floods which are effects of bad climate.

Despite global efforts to address climate change and meet up with the United Nations SDG goal of climate change by 2030, more work needs to be done to meet this target. Limiting global warming to 1.5�C above pre-industrial levels remains the greatest challenge of climate change since the window is closing in and global warming is intensifying. According to the World Metrological Organisation report of 2025, the year 2025 is set to be either the second or third warmest year. 
In another report, the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) reported  that current world climate change actions are insufficient to  meet Paris Agreement�s goals with projected global warming between 2.3 - 2.5 this century, and global average temperatures are likely to exceed the threshold within the next decade.

While many strategies and innovations have been deployed and collaborative efforts by both local and international organisations have contributed to make some progress , the problem of climate change still persists and needs urgent attention if the target must be met.
This challenge is caused by insufficient funding for climate change plans and collaboration by many at national and community level to contribute to this goal.

Despite increasing awareness and commitments, greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and the pace of transition to renewable energy remains slow. One major obstacle is the lack of policy coherence and consistency, hindering effective implementation of climate goals. Additionally, climate finance remains a significant challenge, with many developing countries struggling to access necessary funds for climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.

Furthermore, the complexity of climate change requires a multifaceted approach, involving governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. However, coordinating efforts and ensuring accountability across these diverse stakeholders can be daunting. The recent COP28 agreement to transition away from fossil fuels is a step in the right direction, but its effectiveness will depend on robust implementation and increased ambition.

To overcome these challenges, we need to prioritize climate action, increase investment in clean energy, and promote sustainable land use practices.

In Kenya, the difference is striking: many are aware of environmental issues, yet actions like littering continue because personal responsibility is weak. For climate action to succeed, it must be everyone�s problem. Each choice from how waste is disposed to energy use matters.

This insight directly informs my work on Clinecologic, a smart hospital waste bin I am building to improve waste segregation, prevent contamination, and track carbon emissions in real time.

Many governments continue to treat climate action as a matter of voluntary commitment, not obligation. Those most responsible for emissions often delay action, while vulnerable countries�who have contributed the least�are left paying the highest price. This imbalance creates a global distrust that slows cooperation, financing, and policy implementation.

Another part of this challenge is that climate action is often reduced to technical solutions like renewable energy, carbon markets, or infrastructure. These are essential, but they ignore the human dimensions of the crisis: migration pressures, loss of culture, health impacts, and the rights of communities on the front lines. When climate policies fail to protect people, they lose legitimacy and social support.

This disconnect shows up in how climate finance works, too. Funds move slowly or get tied up in large projects that don�t trickle down to the people who need adaptation support the most. Meanwhile, local innovators, farmers, and community groups already know what works in their regions but lack resources, data, and policy backing to scale their solutions.

Another core issue is the communication gap between science and citizens.

Too often, climate initiatives are designed at a high level with assumptions that what works in one place will work everywhere. Yet in the communities I work with in South-Western Nigeria, climate-smart practices succeed only when they respect local knowledge, traditions, and daily realities.

For example, while farmers understand that soil erosion and unpredictable rains threaten their livelihoods, solutions that require expensive equipment or complex procedures are rarely adopted. 

Likewise, students are eager to learn about recycling, but lessons only take root when they are hands-on and directly connected to their environment. The disconnect between well-intentioned interventions and real-life feasibility slows progress and risks disengagement.

Addressing this challenge requires co-creating solutions with communities, listening as much as advising, and building initiatives that are both scientifically sound and practically achievable. It also requires linking local action to broader policy discussions, so successes in villages and schools can inform regional and national strategies. 

Without this grounded, inclusive approach, even the best ideas remain on paper rather than transforming lives and landscapes.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the lack of integrated, community-driven approaches that connect environmental sustainability with social and economic development. While international agreements and national policies are critical, many climate interventions fail to reach vulnerable communities effectively due to limited awareness, inadequate resources, and weak local participation. Climate change impact including range from extreme weather events to shifts in disease patterns, greatly affect populations with limited adaptive capacity, worsening health inequities and social vulnerabilities.
Another major challenge is bridging knowledge gaps and translating scientific research into practical solutions at the community level. Also, insufficient recognition of the role of families and local actors in promoting sustainable behaviours limits the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing emissions and conserving natural resources.
Financial and policy barriers further complicate climate action. Many developing regions struggle to implement climate strategies due to limited funding, competing priorities, and inconsistent policy enforcement.

Another barrier to youth engagement is that despite a desire to act, most youth do not understand technical terminology surrounding climate change, do not have grooming mentors, or don't understand where to start. This lack of understanding creates uncertainty, and thus, uncertainty produces inaction; the silence of disconnected youth creates a danger for the future of climate action, greater than any statistic.

Finally, policymakers do not connect with the communities that are most affected. Climate policy is crafted far from the community realities that will be impacted, leading to solutions that do not take into account local culture, context, or personal experience.

The ocean covers 71% of the Earth�s surface and is the main regulator of climate through thermohaline circulation and meteorological processes. It is also humanity�s largest carbon pump, absorbing about 25% of anthropogenic CO? emissions each year (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019).  

Coastal �blue carbon� ecosystems play a decisive role: mangroves sequester 22-29 tons of CO? per hectare per year, salt marshes 7-22 tons, and seagrass meadows 4-15 tons (Mcleod et al., 2011; Duarte et al., 2013). By comparison, tropical forests sequester 4-7 tons per hectare per year, but their carbon stocks are more vulnerable to disturbances such as deforestation and fires (IPCC, 2019). Blue carbon ecosystems provide denser and more stable sequestration, as carbon is buried in anaerobic sediments that can preserve it for millennia.  

Safeguarding these ecosystems reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide the main driver of climate change while strengthening the resilience of coastal communities against erosion, storms, and sea-level rise.

Working in carbon finance and sustainable energy, I see firsthand how complex funding structures, limited capacity, and slow disbursement prevent transformative projects from reaching the people who need them most. Without fair financing mechanisms and stronger implementation frameworks, communities facing the most severe climate impacts remain under-resourced and excluded from shaping solutions that affect their lives.
Additionally, many climate actions still rely on top-down approaches that overlook indigenous knowledge, local context, and community agency. This weakens long-term sustainability and trust.

To accelerate progress, climate action must priotize accessibility, equity, and accountability.

The Biggest Challenge for Climate Action Today

I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is mobilizing collective action and translating awareness into meaningful behavior change. While scientific knowledge about climate change is widely available, many individuals and communities struggle to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. People often recognize the urgency of climate issues but feel powerless or uncertain about how to make a tangible impact, which slows down global progress.

Another critical aspect is policy implementation and governance. Many countries have developed climate policies, but gaps in coordination, enforcement, and resource allocation prevent these policies from achieving real-world impact. Without strong governance, even well-designed policies may fail to reduce emissions or support vulnerable communities effectively.

Equity and inclusion also remain central challenges. Women, youth, and marginalized populations are often disproportionately affected by climate change but have limited representation in decision-making processes. Solutions that do not consider inclusivity risk being ineffective or unsustainable.

Finally, climate financing and technological innovation are essential but often inadequate. Transitioning to renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and resilient infrastructure requires substantial investment and innovation, which are not always accessible or equitably distributed",0.5081055,0.29355323,0.35178876,0.815487119041893,#f3a134
1630,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and meaningful implementation. Many people understand that climate change is a threat, but communities�especially in developing countries�often lack the resources, technical support, and enabling policies needed to take concrete action. This creates a situation where solutions exist but are not scaled, and local actors remain limited in what they can achieve. Another major challenge is the low involvement of young people, despite their potential to drive change. Youth often have ideas and energy, but they face barriers such as limited funding, lack of training, and weak institutional support. Finally, climate action suffers from poor coordination among stakeholders. Governments, civil society, and communities frequently work in isolation, which reduces the impact of interventions. Overcoming these challenges requires increased investment in local initiatives, stronger youth empowerment, and better collaboration to turn awareness into real, sustained action.",0.42166948,0.32665598,0.40727925,0.8217106577620191,#f3a134
1631,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the persistent gap between participation and real influence. Through my work with Coastal Conservancy Organisation in Ghana, I have seen how communities are often included in climate discussions only at the lower rungs of Arnstein�s Ladder, that is, informing, consulting, or placation. These forms of participation create the appearance of inclusion but rarely transfer decision-making power, especially to frontline communities in the Global South who experience climate impacts most directly.

This leads to policies or circular economy interventions that are technically well-designed but disconnected from the needs, priorities, and lived realities of local people. Even when ambitious global commitments exist, governance gaps, insufficient finance, and limited institutional capacity slow implementation on the ground.

Another barrier is fragmented cooperation: governments, businesses, and civil society often work in silos instead of through meaningful partnerships.

I have seen people who know about separation at source but choose not to do it. Governments are quick to develop climate goals and targets, yet divert climate funds to other sectors they deem crucial. This highlights the knowledge-behaviour gap, where people have superficial knowledge that does not compel them to change their behaviour. Thus, the significance of my study. Looking beyond surface-level knowledge and fostering a deeper understanding of waste management and its impact on the environment.

One major barrier is limited funding. Climate-vulnerable countries receive less than 12% of the climate finance they need to protect themselves from floods, droughts, and heatwaves (UNFCCC, 2023). Without money, it is hard for communities to improve drainage, manage waste, or support local innovators.

Another challenge is poor waste management, especially in fast-growing cities. Ghana imports over 800,000 tonnes of plastic each year, yet recycles under 10% (World Economic Forum, 2023). These plastics block drains, pollute water, and turn normal rainfall into dangerous floods.

A major part of the problem lies in the limited access to climate education. Without a clear understanding of how climate change works, its local impacts, and the solutions available, it is difficult for people to change behaviors or engage in long-term initiatives. This challenge is particularly strong in regions where daily economic pressures make environmental concerns seem secondary.

Developing countries, smallholder farmers, and vulnerable communities�those who contribute the least to climate change�often receive the least support. Meanwhile, promised global climate finance frequently falls short or arrives too slowly.

3. Fossil fuel dependence is still strong.

Despite renewable energy growth, global fossil fuel consumption is still rising in many regions. The economic and political power of fossil fuel industries slows the transition.

In seasons of intense drought, the heat rises, livestock die, and families ration water for cooking, leaving none for sanitation or crops. These are the moments when climate change becomes a daily negotiation for survival.

Yet when I sit in international climate spaces, water is often discussed in abstract terms: large dams, billion-dollar adaptation funds, regional pipelines ""to be constructed"" years from now. Meanwhile, women in rural Kenya are deciding whether to walk 10 kilometres to a riverbed or send their daughters instead. The policies and the lived experience exist in two different worlds.

This disconnect leaves frontline communities carrying the physical, emotional, and economic weight of a crisis they did not create.

This gap in awareness fuels apathy, misinformation, and resistance to climate-friendly practices or policies. When people do not fully understand the urgency of the crisis or the role they personally play in worsening or solving it, efforts toward sustainability often lose momentum.
Another layer of the problem is that climate education is not always accessible or relatable. Technical language, limited outreach, and the absence of localized storytelling make it harder for communities to connect with the issue. In countries like Nigeria, this challenge is even more visible, as immediate economic concerns often overshadow long-term environmental risks.

Personally, I clearly did not know how to begin or to change anything or how one person can contribute to something before I joining any environment organization. Part of that confusion, and the absence of a clear understanding regarding the urgency of climate action, made me understand that one of the greatest challenges to climate action nowadays is the gap between knowledge/awareness and implementation.
Although the topic of the climate crisis is more popular than ever, still, many individuals remain unaware of the steps they can and should take in practice and the reason why it is important. Such information unavailability and relatability do not allow the communities, in particular the youth, to take full part in climate solutions. This has led to awareness, but little has been done to implement it.
This issue has even greater roots in the Global South.

Yet only 10% of global climate finance is actually directed towards adaptation, even though this is the most urgent need for most countries in the Global South. The young project leaders I work with are faced with complicated financing systems, very long delays, and technical requirements that are unsuited to their reality.
Added to this is a lack of representation: international decisions are still too far removed from the communities that suffer the direct consequences.

We already have many proven options � from renewable energy and energy efficiency to agroecology, climate-smart agriculture and nature-based solutions. Yet emissions keep rising, vulnerable communities face worsening losses and damages, and finance is still not reaching the people and places that need it most.

This gap is largely political and structural. Powerful interests benefit from maintaining high-carbon systems, while many governments face competing short-term priorities, limited fiscal space and weak institutions. At the same time, climate justice is often treated as an add-on, instead of a central principle. Voices from the Global South, indigenous peoples, smallholder farmers, and youth are still under-represented where key decisions are taken.

For me, closing this implementation and justice gap means three things:
- Aligning finance and rules so that public and private investments flow consistently towards low-carbon, climate-resilient pathways, especially in developing countries.
- Building inclusive governance, where those most affected by climate change help design and monitor policies.

Developing countries with ambitious national pledges couldn't meet up with the financial capacity to actualise them. Most nations are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, they find it challenging to invest in the low-carbon alternatives that would have mitigated climate impacts.
For instance, the recently concluded COP30 in Bel�m lends credence to a paradox; the Bel�m resolution intends to triple adaptation finance by 2035. Yet, no firm commitments to ending fossil fuel dependency.
In my country, Nigeria, this paradox is a reality. Farmers along the River Benue trough were forced to rebuild their life after the devastating flooding of 2022 that displaced over 1.4 million people and about $6.7 billion in loss and damage. Nigeria needs an annual investment of approximately $29.7 billion until 2030 for mitigation and adaptation. But, only $2.5 billion was allotted for climate action in 2022, leading to an annual finance gap of over $27.2 billion. On the other hand, the government spent an estimated $9.3 billion on fossil fuel subsidies in 2022 (same year), four times climate action investment.
These statistics indicate the paradox. The developed nations have financial pledges to fulfil and the Global South have a commitment role to play towards implementing their climate action plans.

While they live the realities of climate change every day, their voices rarely shape the policies meant to protect them.

Geopolitics adds another layer. As global tensions rise, climate action is often sidelined for short-term political interests. Countries make promises but delay commitments, and the urgency of climate justice gets lost in competing national agendas.

This is made worse by the role of mainstream media, which frequently prioritises trending stories over environmental issues. The lived suffering of vulnerable communities is overshadowed, while a small but influential group continues to deny or downplay climate change, slowing public understanding and political will.

Many technological solutions, perceived as the key to the climate crisis, are yet to be scientifically proven on a large-scale adoption, as most of them are only demonstrated on a small pilot scale. For instance, carbon capture and storage, even though many empirical research report potential high risk of failure with increase in size of CCN project, industries and climate policy makers continue to promote such a technology as a way out of the climate mess. 

Another example is the Marine Cloud Brightening, which is a technique that involves spraying tiny particles of sea salt into low-lying marine clouds in order to increase the amount of incoming solar radiation reflected back into space and producing a temporary cooling effect. 

While this has also been a heavy debate amongst researchers, more research funds are still put for further studies.

From my work in Senegal, I see this gap clearly. A forest conservation policy might be scientifically sound, but if it doesn't integrate the needs of local communities who depend on that resources for fuel and livelihood, it is destined to fail. Similarly, promoting climate-smart agriculture is ineffective if small farmers, who are the main stakeholders of our food systems, lack the resources and training to adopt new practices.

This challenge is compounded by inadequate funding mechanisms that bypass local institutions and a lack of accessible technology for data-driven decision-making in rural areas.

 Despite more than 80 countries backing a roadmap for a fossil-fuel phase-out, the final agreement dropped binding commitments to phase out fossil fuels under pressure from oil-producing nations.  This reflects a more profound structural dilemma: many nations face the dual challenge of rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions while sustaining economic growth and competitiveness. The shift of energy focus from coal, oil, and gas to clean energy is often viewed as a threat to the existing industries and trade balances, making ambitious climate action economically risky. Consequently, while decarbonization is making headway, the pace remains too slow. Many countries are reticent to fully commit to their national plans (NDCs) or adaptation strategies. At the same time, countries in the global south continue to bear the burden of climate impacts (heat, drought, and rising sea levels) even as promised climate-adaptation funds lag.

The problem is that many climate policies are designed using global templates rather than grounded in the realities of specific regions.

1685,"The main obstacle facing climate action today is the ongoing gap between systematic policy execution and scientific evidence, which is made worse by conflicting interests, transient economic pressures, and poor coordination between sectors and countries.  Despite the substantial evidence of human-caused climate change and its disastrous effects presented by climate scientists, this knowledge has not resulted in appropriate, coordinated global action. Policymakers operate within political cycles that favor short-term economic advantages over long-term planetary health.  Second, despite obvious scientific demands for quick decarbonization, the political economics of fossil fuels is still firmly established, with strong industries effectively pushing to stall climate legislation.  Third, while having made the least historical contribution to emissions, Global South countries suffer disproportionately from climate change, yet they lack the funding and technology transfer necessary for climate adaptation and mitigation. This is a terrible contradiction.  Policymakers need clear, practical findings that are translated into economic and social terms, whereas climate experts speak in probabilistic models and technical jargon.  Fifth, the division of climate action inside environmental ministries separates it from trade, healthcare, agriculture, and energy policies areas where radical change is most desperately required.

While global conversations about climate change are happening, the voices of those most affected are often overlooked, and policies do not always reflect the realities on the ground. Solutions designed in one context can fail when applied elsewhere which migh leave communities sadly underserved. Youth engagement is another major challenge. Young people are passionate and ready to act, yet we often lack resources and guidance to turn ideas into tangible impact. I think it�s time for bold ideas to emerge because we are too often tied to repeating the same rhetoric, the same narratives, without creating real change. At the last COP, for example, we saw some progress in advancing the inclusion of indigenous communities, who are at the forefront of protecting the environment. In Morocco, I�ve witnessed communities in the Atlas mountains implementing sustainable solutions, like traditional water management systems, that are both practical and innovative. These examples show how critical it is to include Global South perspectives in discussions about sustainability. Our generation is witnessing and experiencing the impacts of climate change firsthand, and urgent action is needed to include youth in discussions. At this event, I want to advocate for these challenges and push for inclusive policies that empower communities to take ownership of their future.",0.37456512,0.49694675,0.5404756,0.692754043036125,#f7e379
1687,"For me, the biggest challenge for climate action today is achieving climate justice. Countries that contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions should bear the greatest responsibility for the loss and damages caused in nations that are least responsible, especially those in the Global South. In Morocco, for example, we�ve felt the impact of climate change firsthand. Over the past seven years, persistent droughts have devastated rural communities, drained water sources, and had serious economic consequences. Rising prices and inflation have been fueled in part by these climate disasters, and the government spends substantial resources just to mitigate the losses. This is why advancing loss and damage funds (a key agenda in COP discussions) is essential. Without it, climate action remains incomplete and unfair. Another challenge is how climate action is often tied to political agendas. When leaders deny climate change or withdraw from international agreements, like the United States under President Trump, the engagement of major powers is disrupted, slowing progress globally.

The persistent disconnect between what we know needs to be done and what actually happens on the ground. This gap is driven by a complex interplay of political, economic, and social constraints that, my first-hand experience suggests, slow or dilute climate commitments. 

Climate action is limited by behavioural and societal inertia. As part of the research we were conducting in the nearby villages, we observed that even when technologies exist, adoption is slow because habits, incentives, and social norms are difficult to change. I strongly feel that effective climate action, therefore, requires a cultural shift toward sustainability, supported by community engagement. These two problems exist at the local community level.

At the structural or national level, climate finance remains insufficient and uneven, weakening incentives to invest in renewable infrastructure. Wealthier nations delay fulfilling commitments, creating mistrust. In countries of the Global South, fossil fuel�dependent industries resist transitions that threaten existing economic structures.

Another challenge is the central issue of climate justice. Communities that contribute least to emissions, such as those in South Asia, Africa, and small island nations, face the harshest impacts. Inclusivity and Equity issues need to be addressed quickly.

It becomes difficult for people to focus on long term climate issues when short term challenges like income, food, and electricity are more urgent. Another major challenge is access to resources and opportunities. In many developing countries, including Nigeria, young people have ideas and passion but lack the funding, support, and platforms to turn their ideas into real projects. This limits innovation and prevents community level solutions from growing. Without strong support systems, many potential climate leaders don�t get the chance to contribute. There is also the issue of misinformation and lack of simple, clear education on climate issues. A lot of young people want to help but don�t know where to start or what actions truly make a difference. Climate action becomes something distant instead of practical.

Without credible data systems, climate decisions rely on assumptions; without accessible financing, adaptation becomes slow; and without inclusive governance, young people and local innovators are left out of shaping solutions.

Another critical challenge is the lack of climate literacy among citizens and small businesses. The people most affected by climate impacts often lack the tools to measure their own environmental footprint or understand their role in mitigation.

I believe the real issue isn�t a lack of ambition, but a gap in connection between finance and innovation, policy and community, developed and developing nations. Without closing this gap, we risk building ideas that inspire, but don�t transform.

To overcome this, we must rethink how we design and fund climate solutions. That means empowering young innovators with access to green finance, integrating digital tools for transparency, and ensuring inclusivity so that voices from the Global South are part of the conversation.

The real problem is that these solutions rarely reach the people who need them most, in the form they need them, at the time they need them.

Climate action in Africa faces the challenge of inequitable digital access. While technology holds incredible potential AI, remote sensing, early-warning apps�digital literacy, internet affordability, gender gaps, and device access create barriers that must be acknowledged and designed around. This is one reason I work intentionally with tools like WhatsApp, FM radio, offline AI, and interactive voice systems in local languages. Technology must adapt to people, not the other way around.

In summary, the biggest challenge is not a lack of innovation or climate solutions; it is the failure to bridge the last mile the point where climate science becomes daily reality for farmers, pastoralists, fishers, and rural families whose livelihoods depend entirely on the environment. The climate fight in Africa will be won or lost at the community level, not at conferences or policy tables.",0.49125242,0.70139325,0.6441002,0.6348777962435199,#f7e379
1718,"For me, one of the biggest challenges in climate action today is the unfairness in climate finance. Many developing countries, including those most affected by climate change, simply don�t have enough access to funding for adaptation, clean energy, or resilience. This inequality slows down progress and leaves vulnerable communities struggling on their own.

Another challenge is the slow pace of policy implementation. Even when governments make promises or set climate targets, the follow through often takes too long. Policies sometimes stay on paper instead of turning into real action, and by the time they move forward, the climate crisis has already worsened.

Overconsumption and waste also play a huge role. The way we produce and consume today is not sustainable, and it creates enormous pressure on the planet. Changing habits, both at the individual and corporate level, is difficult, but absolutely necessary.

Lastly, I believe that a lack of climate education holds us back. Many people still don�t fully understand the seriousness of climate change or how their choices impact the environment. If climate education were stronger and more accessible, more people would feel empowered to take action.
Addressing these challenges requires fairness, urgency, and awareness. I hope to contribute to solutions in these areas through my studies and future career.",0.43271828,0.31884313,0.3696767,0.7234690759746267,#f3a134
1719,"I think the biggest challenge for climate action today is awareness and coordinated action. Many people, especially in developing countries like Nigeria, are affected by climate issues but don�t fully understand the causes or the solutions. This makes it harder to implement effective changes at the community or policy level.
Another big challenge is resources and infrastructure. Even when people or governments want to act, limited funding, outdated systems, and lack of access to technology often slow down progress. For example, waste management, renewable energy adoption, and flood prevention need strong systems and investment to be sustainable.
Finally, I see integration and collaboration as a key hurdle. Climate action needs governments, communities, private sector, and technology to work together. Often, these groups operate in isolation, which reduces the impact of efforts that are being made.
I�m interested in exploring how technology and innovation can help overcome these challenges. Simple digital tools for tracking energy use, raising awareness, and improving coordination could make a difference.

1720,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the persistent disconnect between climate policy commitments and meaningful implementation in the most climate-vulnerable regions.

I will center my discussion on three specific challenges:
First is the implementation gap. We continually witnessed that Climate finance pledged by developed nations consistently falls short of commitments, and even when funds do flow, bureaucratic complexities make them inaccessible to local governments and community organizations best positioned to implement adaptation. 

Second is the representation gap. Climate policy continues to be shaped predominantly by Global North institutions, with insufficient meaningful participation from communities most affected by climate impacts. This results in solutions that sound good in Brussels or New York but fail when confronted with ground-level realities of resource constraints, cultural contexts, and competing development priorities.

Third, the urgency gap. It is sad to know that while vulnerable communities experience climate impacts now, such as failing harvests, water scarcity, and displacement, policy responses remain slow, focused on long-term targets, while immediate adaptation needs go unmet.

Addressing these gaps requires reimagining climate governance to prioritize locally led adaptation, simplify access to climate finance for frontline actors, and center the voices of those most affected in policy design. ",0.66293764,0.5453574,0.69454837,0.7666763679611808,#f3a134
1721,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and action, made even wider by trust, cost, and competing everyday priorities. Many people now recognize climate change as real, but knowing does not automatically translate into doing.

Climate solutions often arrive shaped for places with strong systems�consistent electricity, funded waste management, easy recycling loops, and public incentives. For low-resource settings, these same solutions look distant or expensive, so people disconnect from the conversation. When action feels designed for someone else�s reality, urgency loses its power.

Another layer is trust. Climate messaging sometimes sounds like blame or restriction rather than shared survival, which makes communities defensive instead of motivated. People respond better to proof they can touch�small local pilots, familiar tools, clear savings, and solutions tied to health, income, or daily comfort.

The real challenge is making climate action feel possible for everyone, built around existing community habits, without demanding resources people do not have. Progress will move farther when solutions sound less like instruction and more like collaboration, ownership, and practical benefit. When it fits local life and shows immediate value, climate action stops being a global slogan and becomes a personal stake.",0.31031108,0.2317394,0.45455527,0.7785736507080611,#f3a134

This disconnect creates a cycle where policies are designed far away from the lived experiences of the people they aim to serve, resulting in solutions that are often symbolic rather than transformative.
Another major challenge is the lack of meaningful youth and gender-inclusive leadership. Young people and women consistently drive grassroots climate resilience, yet they remain underrepresented in formal negotiations and policy spaces. Their knowledge rooted in daily interactions with land, water, and community is rarely acknowledged as expertise.
Finally, climate action struggles with fragmentation. We talk about energy, water, agriculture, and migration as separate issues, when in reality they are deeply interconnected.

When I visited schools and communities to promote vermicomposting, almost everyone agreed managing organic waste or improving soil health is important. But turning awareness into practice was much harder. Many said they were �too busy,� had no space, or will start later. I think this gap between knowing and doing is similar to the global climate challenge. Communities want to act but often lack simple guidance or small resources. Even a low-cost compost bin feel like extra burden. Communication is another challenge. When I explained climate change through soil health, waste reduction, or how earthworms improve fertility, people understood faster but Most climate messages are too technical or distant from local realities. The biggest challenge isn�t just technology or emissions, it�s motivating people to adopt small, consistent actions and making sustainable practices simple.

We can say that climate emissions, fossil fuels and other issues are the largest challenges but I put all of these actions under the umbrella of a lack of respect for the earths natural resources and human life. The impacts of climate change are felt globally but the extremes are felt in smaller countries and islands whose economies are heavily dependent on the natural environment. Most first world countries have access to the funding and other resources necessary to build climate resilient systems and I believe that due to this, these nations are less empathetic to smaller economies who are just as important in the global community. On the other hand, while respect for the environment is lacking among our leaders, ordinary citizens are just as guilty as they too do not respect the environment and display this disregard through improper garbage disposal and deforestation further making climate action a big challenge. I believe that climate action today can advance when everyone respects the environment and plays their part in keeping it green and clean and holding not only our leaders but our neighbors and businesses accountable for the role that they also play in climate change.

Frequent flooding and waterlogging destroy homes, roads, and cropland almost every year, with limited recovery support.

Severe riverbank erosion forces families to lose land and shelter, creating climate refugees without long-term resettlement planning.

Saltwater intrusion contaminates drinking water, reduces soil fertility, and threatens food security and coastal livelihoods.

Rising climate-induced displacement is evident, yet social protection systems and climate-resilient planning remain insufficient.

Weak local implementation of policies prevents national and global strategies from reaching the communities that need them most.

Limited access to climate finance and loss-and-damage funding restricts large-scale adaptation.

Local scientific knowledge and youth participation remain underutilized in decision-making and adaptation planning.

1727,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between commitments and real implementation. While many governments, corporations, and global leaders openly acknowledge the urgency of climate change, actual actions often fall far short of what is required. This discrepancy is fueled by economic interests, political hesitation, and competing national priorities. Many countries, especially developing ones, struggle to balance climate action with the immediate need for economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. As a result, climate policies are implemented slowly, inconsistently, or with insufficient funding.

Another key challenge is the lack of coordinated global responsibility. Climate change does not respect borders, yet countries respond with fragmented policies. Wealthier nations historically the biggest polluters have the resources to adapt and innovate, while poorer countries face climate impacts more severely and lack financing for mitigation tools like clean energy, resilient infrastructure, and sustainable agriculture.

Additionally, misinformation and public skepticism significantly delay progress. Some groups still deny climate science or resist transitioning away from fossil fuels due to perceived economic risks.

1728,"I believe the single greatest challenge for climate action today is the ""Knowledge-Action Gap.""

While global awareness of the climate crisis is at an all-time high, there remains a critical disconnect between understanding the science and taking tangible, sustained action. For many young people, especially in the Global South, climate change feels abstract, overwhelming, or inevitable. This often leads to ""eco-anxiety"" or paralysis, where individuals feel too small to make a difference.

This challenge is fundamentally educational. Traditional curricula often teach students about the problems (rising temperatures, melting ice) but fail to equip them with the competence to build solutions.

To bridge this gap, we must transform education from passive learning to active problem-solving. We need to integrate tools like AI and STEM to help students visualize their impact and design real-world interventions.

1729,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and responsibility. Many people know that climate change is real, but very few feel personally responsible for responding to it. In my community, climate degradation like deforestation, bush burning, even floods, are normalized as �part of life,� and the urgency of climate action is often lost in the struggle for daily survival. When climate change is seen as a distant global discussion instead of a lived experience, people don�t feel the need to act.

Governments also tend to respond reactively rather than proactively. Policies are often shaped after a crisis happens, instead of being used to prevent it. This makes climate action feel temporary, not structural. Without stronger community ownership or long-term planning, even good initiatives will struggle for sustainability.

I think the real challenge is making climate action feel personal and possible. If people do not see themselves in the solution, they disconnect from the problem. That is where youth leadership becomes important, not just to raise awareness, but to change how climate action is communicated and practiced locally.

What we need urgently, as I have said before, is a shift in mindset: from �climate is happening to us� to �we are part of the climate response.� If that shift happens, policies can be stronger, communities can adapt faster, and climate action can become a shared responsibility rather than a distant ideology.",0.3434801,0.34500664,0.3422531,0.7142121562550813,#f3a134

Lack of Accessible Climate Literacy: Education is often too abstract, failing to provide practical, region-specific guidance and skills�like technological literacy�to empower communities to act effectively.

Financial Disconnect: International climate funding and policy mechanisms often struggle to reach the grassroots organizations and local initiatives where adaptation and mitigation efforts are actually implemented.

In my work in the Deep South of Thailand, I see this gap clearly. Government agencies often have data on flood risks, but local communities frequently lack timely warnings or the specific means to act on them. This issue is compounded for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, and bedridden patients who require specific types of assistance that general alerts do not address.

This creates an inequality of resilience where safety depends on digital literacy or physical ability. The challenge is not just reducing carbon emissions but adapting our systems to be radically inclusive. We must build infrastructure that listens as well as it speaks to ensure that climate response mechanisms are designed with the people who need them most.

Achieving this will set up global climate actions for success.

Technical challenges also exist. There are existing sectors and infrastructures that have been locked in place for a long time. These include sectors like aviation and shipping and plant infrastructures. It is very challenging to decarbonise these sectors and transition them into clean energy, in terms of the innovation and cost it needs. This is particularly relevant in developing countries, where there are limited financial resources, priority issues and higher reliance on climate sensitive sectors.

Another challenge is the treatment of environmental costs as an externality. The government and market system rewards profits and political gains. This keeps fossil fuels in play and leaves climate damage as an external avoided cost. It is a challenge to bring in clean energy and sustainable practices into play if they appear to be expensive.

Without accurate data, policies often miss the realities on the ground, and resources do not reach those who need them most.

 inequality and poverty intensify climate impacts. Many households facing socioeconomic hardship prioritize immediate survival needs over long-term environmental solutions. This creates a cycle where the people most affected by climate change are the least able to adapt, making inclusive climate action even more challenging. One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and meaningful implementation. Around the world, people increasingly understand that climate change is real and urgent, yet translating this awareness into coordinated, large-scale action remains difficult. This gap is driven by three interconnected barriers.

While ambitious targets and international agreements exist, many frontline communities still lack access to financing, infrastructure, technology, and decision-making power needed to implement solutions at scale.

Climate action is further slowed by inequality in responsibility and resources. Those who contribute least to emissions often face the harshest impacts such as drought, flooding, food insecurity, and energy instability, yet they remain underrepresented in global policy spaces. This imbalance undermines trust in climate processes and weakens the effectiveness of global cooperation.

Another major challenge is that climate solutions are still too often designed in isolation from social realities. When climate action does not simultaneously address poverty, gender inequality, education, and digital access, it risks becoming unsustainable or extractive.

We have groundbreaking ideas�renewable tech, circular-economy models, AI for climate prediction, community financing systems�but most don�t reach the communities that need them most. This �deployment gap� is driven by limited financing, fragmented governance, slow public�private coordination, and the lack of accessible platforms for local participation.
From my experience working in innovation and humanitarian contexts, I�ve seen how climate impacts�floods, displacement, pollution�hit hardest in places where systems for early warning, data collection, or community investment barely exist. Many solutions are designed globally but fail to integrate local culture, economics, or youth-driven creativity.
What we need is not just more technology, but systems that make innovation usable: community-owned financing tools, youth-led climate enterprises, localized climate intelligence, and platforms that turn awareness into actionable, funded projects.
The challenge is ensuring climate innovation is not elitist or centralized, but participatory, affordable, and grounded in real community needs.

1779,"One of the biggest challenges with climate action is the gap between awareness and meaningful implementation. While many people understand that climate change is real and dangerous, translating this awareness into practical, sustained action remains difficult. Limited financial resources make it hard for vulnerable communities�especially those in arid regions like Turkana�to adopt climate-smart technologies, plant trees, conserve water, or shift to sustainable livelihoods.

Another major challenge is the lack of strong policy enforcement. Even when climate policies exist, they are often poorly implemented due to weak governance, limited funding, or competing political priorities. Communities on the frontlines of climate change often receive minimal support or information to adapt effectively.

Additionally, climate change is a complex global issue, yet its impacts are felt locally. This makes coordination between governments, organizations, and local communities difficult. Misinformation, low public participation, and limited access to climate education further slow progress.

Lastly, the increasing severity of climate disasters�droughts, floods, heatwaves�creates an environment where communities are constantly responding to emergencies rather than planning for long-term resilience. This cycle of vulnerability makes sustained climate action challenging but also highlights why it is urgently needed.",0.59219766,0.141572,0.4567361,0.7850913018777861,#f3a134

People increasingly recognize the urgency of the climate crisis, yet translating that awareness into coordinated, sustained action remains difficult. A major reason is that political and economic systems still prioritize short-term gains over long-term resilience. Even when governments set ambitious goals, progress is slowed by limited funding, competing interests, and pressure from industries invested in fossil fuels.

Another challenge is the deep inequity in how climate impacts are experienced. Communities that contribute the least to emissions often face the greatest risks, yet they typically have fewer resources to adapt. This makes it harder to build unified support for climate policies, especially when those with decision-making power are not feeling the most immediate effects.

Misinformation and climate fatigue also weaken momentum. Constant exposure to alarming news can overwhelm people, while misinformation campaigns continue to sow doubt and delay action.

In Kenya and many other countries, the impacts of climate change are already disrupting daily life through floods, droughts, heatwaves, and the erosion of livelihoods. Yet, we remain largely reactive rather than proactive, responding to disasters after they occur rather than investing in long-term planning, prevention, and resilience. 

This mindset is evident at both the community and government levels. Many citizens view climate change as distant or abstract, not a present and escalating threat, unaware that their everyday choices either worsen the problem or contribute to the solution. Governments focus on short-term political and economic ambitions, often overshadowing strategic climate investments. Policies that would strengthen resilience, such as enforcing planning regulations, promoting green buildings, or protecting ecosystems, are frequently deprioritized because they do not offer immediate political returns.

What troubles me most is that this lack of urgency allows vulnerability to grow. With every disaster, we witness loss, suffering, and damage that could have been avoided with stronger foresight. In the built environment sector, I see how difficult it is to shift the conversation from crisis response to resilience planning.

Political systems are constrained by election cycles, economies prioritize quarterly performance, and societies are often drawn to immediate convenience. This short-term focus consistently undermines the sustained action the climate crisis requires.

We have the technology, financial resources, and scientific understanding necessary to address climate change, yet we remain limited by structures that reward short-term gains over long-term stability. This disconnect represents not only a challenge of governance and economics but also a failure of collective responsibility. By prioritizing immediate benefits, we risk compromising the well-being of future generations.

The central task of our time is to overcome this short-term mindset. Doing so requires rethinking our economic and political priorities, strengthening long-term policy frameworks, and fostering a societal culture that values the interests of future generations as much as those of the present. Our legacy will not be defined by a lack of solutions, but by whether we develop the vision and commitment to act beyond the immediate horizon.

This knowledge gap often prevents timely adoption of adaptation and mitigation measures and limits local engagement in climate-resilient practices.
Also, limited awareness among decision-makers can result in inadequate policy formulation, poor resource allocation, and delayed implementation of climate initiatives. Without comprehensive understanding, even technically feasible solutions-such as renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture, or disaster preparedness programs-may fail to gain traction or achieve meaningful impact.

Integrating climate action across sectors is also challenging. Water, energy, agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management are interconnected, yet policies often operate in silos. Hydropower planning, for example, must consider changing precipitation, sedimentation, and GLOF risks, but without cross-sector coordination, solutions can be delayed or ineffective.

Limited public awareness and participation further constrain action. Even well-designed solutions may fail without community engagement and ownership. Global inequities in responsibility and capacity also complicate collective efforts, as vulnerable communities are most affected despite contributing least to emissions.

In many rural areas, like those I work with across Western Kenya, farmers are already grappling with unpredictable rainfall, recurrent droughts, soil degradation, and crop losses. Yet, they often lack access to climate information, finance, and technologies that would help them adapt. This disconnect is intensified by limited investment in locally led solutions, weak early warning systems, and inadequate integration of indigenous knowledge with scientific innovation.

Another critical dimension is the equity challenge. Communities that contribute the least to global emissions bear the greatest burden of climate impacts. Without sufficient climate finance, inclusive decision-making, and meaningful youth engagement, many adaptation efforts remain unsustainable or donor-dependent.

1814,"I believe the most significant challenge for climate action today is the disconnect between high-level policy and effective, inclusive implementation at the local level. While global agreements and national targets are crucial, they often fail to account for the complex socio-economic realities on the ground.

From my work in Senegal, I see this gap clearly. A forest conservation policy might be scientifically sound, but if it doesn't integrate the needs of local communities who depend on that land for fuel and livelihood, it is destined to fail. Similarly, promoting climate-smart agriculture is ineffective if small  farmers, who are the main stakeholders of our food systems, lack the resources and training to adopt new practices.

This challenge is compounded by inadequate funding mechanisms that bypass local institutions and a lack of accessible technology for data-driven decision-making in rural areas. The true hurdle is not a lack of will, but a failure to build bridges to translate global ambition into localized, co-designed solutions that empower communities, ensure a just transition, and make climate action directly relevant to people's daily lives and economic survival.",0.54071355,0.6629251,0.6345147,0.7502080035555019,#f3a134
1815,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between scientific evidence and policy implementation. During a lecture by Tom Brook (WWF-UK) at the St Andrews Summer School, he emphasised that science depends on evidence, and policies must be grounded in that evidence. This idea has stayed with me because, as researchers, we are generating valuable data and insightyet much of it does not reach policymakers in a usable form. As a result, many solutions remain in academic spaces instead of shaping real actions on the ground.

Another major challenge is that climate knowledge exists in multiple �languages.� Scientific papers, policy briefs, community experiences, and traditional knowledge systems all express climate realities differently. There is no single shared language across these domains, and much knowledge is lost, overlooked, or undervalued simply because it is not communicated in a form that other groups can understand. This limits collaboration, prevents local wisdom from informing global strategies, and reinforces inequities between the Global North and South.

To strengthen climate action, we need inclusive platforms like Ideas Lab, where scientists, policymakers, youth, and communities can share, translate, and connect their knowledge. Bridging these gaps will help ensure that evidence becomes policy, that local wisdom informs solutions, and that climate action becomes more equitable, practical, and grounded in lived experience.",0.21540785,0.5439694,0.48054945,0.640981406494631,#f7e379

Around the world, we have early-warning systems, climate data, adaptation models, and renewable energy solutions. But these tools are not reaching the people and institutions who need them the most, either because the systems are too expensive, too centralized, or not adapted to local realities.

This implementation gap is made worse by fragmented governance. Climate action requires coordination between governments, the private sector, researchers, and local communities, yet these actors often work in silos. As a result, important decisions are delayed, data is not shared, and innovation moves slower than the speed of the climate crisis.
For many countries in the Global South, the challenge is also a matter of equity. They contribute very little to global emissions but face the strongest impacts, while financial and technological resources remain concentrated elsewhere. Without addressing this imbalance, climate action will continue to be unjust and insufficient.

1818,"The greatest challenge in climate action today is not only reducing emissions but closing the equity gap between countries in global effort. This is especially clear in Vietnam. We are highly vulnerable to climate change, facing sea level rise, extreme heat, and drought. But we bear disproportionate pressure in the energy transition. Vietnam has committed to Net Zero by 2050 and launched a USD 15.5 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, but most climate finance remains in the form of loans, not grants. The EU�s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism risks raising export costs if not backed by sufficient technical and financial support. The Loss and Damage mechanism, though symbolically important, has yet to reach affected communities meaningfully.

This disconnect is something I see directly in my work at Frogsleap, where we support businesses and communities in their green transition. Barriers to climate finance, expertise, and fair engagement with global partners persist. Despite strong ambition, local actors remain structurally disadvantaged.
Meanwhile, developed countries invest heavily in domestic adaptation, while countries like Vietnam, despite far lower historical emissions, face debt, infrastructure gaps, and limited influence in shaping global climate governance.

If climate action is to truly succeed, it must go beyond carbon cuts. It must ensure fair, accessible finance and a global system where all nations have the rights and means to transition sustainably.

While people increasingly understand that climate change is real, urgent, and destructive, the resources, systems, and political will needed to take coordinated action are still limited. This gap shows up in weak policies, underfunded climate programs, and a lack of practical tools for communities to adapt and build resilience.

Another major barrier is climate inequality. Those who contribute the least to global emissions such as low-income communities, rural areas, and young people are often the most affected. Yet they have the fewest opportunities to influence decisions, access climate finance, or participate in planning processes. Climate action cannot succeed when the people most impacted remain excluded from solutions.

There is also a significant challenge in the slow adoption of climate-smart practices at local levels. Many communities lack the infrastructure, digital tools, and education needed to transition to sustainable habits.

It is the persistent gap between awareness and action�between knowing what must be done and actually doing it at the necessary scale and speed. Climate change is widely acknowledged as an existential threat, yet collective responses remain fragmented, delayed, and insufficient. This gap is rooted in human behavior, political economy, and structural inequalities, making it the most difficult barrier to overcome.

Yet, within this challenge lies the possibility of transformation. Closing the awareness�action gap requires reframing climate action as an opportunity rather than a sacrifice�an opportunity to create healthier communities, resilient economies, and more equitable societies.

Bioclimatic architecture offers powerful, low-carbon solutions based on passive strategies�orientation, natural ventilation, thermal mass, shading, and local materials. These approaches can drastically reduce energy demand while improving comfort and resilience. However, their wider implementation faces barriers such as lack of awareness, limited training among professionals, cost misconceptions, and the persistence of conventional, carbon-intensive building models.

This gap creates a disconnect between global ambitions and local realities. Without strong awareness and a sense of ownership, climate action is often perceived as an external agenda rather than a shared responsibility. As a result, essential changes in behavior, production models, and resource management remain limited.

Raising awareness is not only about informing; it is about empowering people to act, demonstrating how climate solutions can improve livelihoods, reduce costs, and strengthen resilience. Ownership requires inclusive approaches that place communities, youth, and entrepreneurs at the center of decision-making and innovation.

If we fail to build this collective understanding and engagement, even the best climate policies or technologies will fall short.

This is part of what drives my work, showing that waste can become eco-friendly products people actually use.

There�s also a big awareness gap. Many people hear about climate change but don�t see how it affects their daily lives until disasters like Mokwa happen.

From a Global South perspective, this imbalance is even clearer. Communities facing drought, food insecurity, and extreme weather often lack funding, data, and influence in policy making. Youth-led initiatives exist and grow, yet frequently operate outside formal processes, limiting impact.

Fragmentation across climate governance adds another challenge. Decisions on energy, food systems, water, chemicals, and pollution happen in silos, while real-world impacts are interconnected. Without stronger coordination and inclusion of youth and frontline communities, climate action risks being a series of small wins rather than transformative change.

Firstly, while the Global South bears disproportionate climate impacts despite its comparatively minimal historical emissions, it remains under-represented in decision-making processes. True climate action requires mechanisms that acknowledge differentiated responsibilities and capacities and not �one-size-fits-all� approach.

Secondly, climate policies often are framed from contexts that are far removed from frontline communities. For instance, in Ladakh, international climate frameworks seldom address specific challenges facing high-altitude mountain ecosystems or the unique vulnerabilities of pastoral communities. Thus, bridging this disconnect requires placing local knowledge at the centre and ensuring affected communities shape adaptation strategies in a significant manner.

This challenge is worsened by insufficient youth representation and the under-engagement of women and marginalised groups in decision-making, leading to solutions that may lack community ownership or long-term sustainability. Another issue is the prevalence of �projectisation,� where interventions are short-lived and donor-driven rather than embedded in local contexts for lasting impact. We must adopt models that empower local actors, promote intergenerational leadership, and align funding with both environmental priorities and socio-economic needs.

1846,"The world is facing an unprecedented environmental emergency, with plastic pollution and climate change entwining to exacerbate each other's devastating impacts. The production, consumption, and disposal of plastics have become a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, while climate change, in turn, worsens plastic pollution. This vicious cycle threatens ecosystems, human health, and the planet's very survival.
Plastic pollution is a ticking time bomb. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world's oceans, harming marine life and contaminating the food chain. Microplastics, tiny particles that are ingested by animals, have been found in the gut of seabirds, fish, and even humans. The production of plastics, largely reliant on fossil fuels, contributes to climate change, which in turn intensifies extreme weather events, spreading plastic pollution and making it more persistent and hazardous.
However, these efforts are insufficient. A global, legally binding treaty is needed to address plastic pollution and climate change. The United Nations is working towards establishing such a treaty, but more needs to be done. We must act now to reduce plastic use, transition to renewables, and protect ecosystems. The future of our planet depends on it.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between what we know must be done and what is actually being implemented. Although science is clear and solutions exist, political inertia and short-term priorities slow progress. Many governments hesitate to adopt strong climate policies because they fear economic backlash or political unpopularity. The world also remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and powerful industries often resist change. Global inequality makes the problem worse: countries most affected by climate change have the least resources to adapt, while wealthier nations fall short in providing promised climate finance. Social behavior also changes slowly due to cost barriers, habits, and misinformation. Even when technology is available, deployment is slowed by infrastructure limits, regulatory hurdles, and high costs.

While activists, researchers, and communities are pushing for urgent change, many economic sectors remain locked into linear production models that prioritize extraction and short-term gain over long-term sustainability.

Effective climate action cannot rely on a single actor. It requires coordinated efforts across governments, cities, regions, industries, financial institutions, and communities. Yet the global economic architecture continues to favor practices that intensify climate risks. As economies grow and societies evolve, production will continue to be essential for our survival, but the way we produce must fundamentally shift.

1851,"In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the continued emission of greenhouse gases, which exacerbates global warming and pushes the climate toward irreversible changes. Despite urgent warnings, many countries still rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to increasing emissions that are making it almost impossible to reverse the damage already done.

For instance, at COP30 in Brazil, nations raised bitter objections over fossil fuel cutoff commitments. While more than 80 countries supported a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, opposition from key oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and others, weakened the final agreement. The outcome was a non-binding, voluntary transition plan rather than a strong, legally binding global commitment. This means that fossil fuel emissions continue to rise, further destabilizing the climate action and increasing the risk of irreversible effects like melting ice sheets, deforestation, and extreme weather. Without immediate, decisive action to cut emissions and shift to clean energy, the global community risks facing catastrophic impacts that cannot be undone.

That being the case, I think addressing this challenge requires urgent, coordinated efforts to reduce emissions drastically while supporting vulnerable communities in adapting to the changing climate.",0.84812903,0.24411643,0.13196826,0.7457359677354869,#f3a134
1852,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. While there is growing recognition of climate change and its impacts, translating this awareness into concrete, large-scale action remains difficult. Many governments, businesses, and individuals understand the urgency but struggle with aligning policies, resources, and behaviors to create meaningful change.

Economic and political factors often slow progress. Fossil fuel dependence, competing development priorities, and short-term economic interests frequently overshadow long-term sustainability goals. Additionally, misinformation and lack of education can hinder public understanding, making it harder to build widespread support for climate initiatives.

Another critical challenge is ensuring climate action is equitable. Vulnerable communities are often the most affected by climate impacts, yet they frequently have the least access to resources and decision-making power. Solutions that do not address social and economic inequalities risk leaving these communities behind and failing to achieve systemic changes. 

Overcoming these challenges requires coordinated global action, investment in sustainable technologies, and community-based solutions that empower individuals to take part in the fight against climate change. It also requires effective communication and advocacy to transform awareness into consistent action.

The young people represent a large population of the today society, but most of them fail to see how climate change directly impacts their lives, opportunities and futures. In most today communities, the youth focus on daily survival, such as finding employment, starting small businesses or supporting their families. These activities offer tangible economic rewards like money which everyone needs and prioritizes, making them far more important in their eyes than environmental concerns. As a result, climate action often feels distant and less urgent compared to the immediate need for financial stability.

Many young people also view environmental programs and climate related activities as voluntary commitments that demand time, energy and sometimes resources, yet provide no direct financial return. This caused youth participation in climate initiatives to remain low. Climate change is seen as a long-term environmental issue rather than a present-day threat. It does not always present itself in sudden ways therefore, many struggle to connect it to their immediate challenges such as rising food prices, water shortages, extreme heat and poor living conditions.

The second major problem is that poor countries like India are struggling while rich countries have all the money and technology. India wants to develop and lift people out of poverty, so we need industries and jobs. But we're also told to reduce emissions and protect the environment. It's a difficult choice. Meanwhile, countries that became rich by polluting for centuries now lecture us about climate action. It's unfair.
Water is another huge challenge. In regions like Haryana where I've studied, groundwater is disappearing fast. Climate change is making it worse, but communities don't have money for sustainable solutions. They're just trying to survive.

While policies and initiatives exist at global and national levels, many vulnerable communities remain unaware of climate risks or lack the resources to take meaningful action. This gap leads to uneven implementation of climate solutions and limits the effectiveness of global efforts. Another major challenge is the disconnect between policy-making and grassroots action; decisions are often made without sufficient input from local communities who are directly affected by climate impacts.
Climate change denial, lack of political will, and insufficient funding hinder rapid and coordinated responses. To address these challenges, it is essential to empower communities with knowledge, resources and platforms to participate actively in climate solutions. This includes youth engagement, inclusive advocacy and context-specific projects that consider social, economic and environmental realities.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the Lack of awareness and urgency among the general public, especially in communities where the effects of climate change are not immediately visible. Many people do not fully understand the long-term impact of their daily actions on the environment, which leads to inaction or resistance to change. This is often worsened by limited access to education on climate issues and misinformation.

Another major barrier is The gap between policy and implementation. While many governments and organizations have created climate policies, there is often a lack of resources, political will, or enforcement to turn those plans into real action. Additionally, Economic priorities frequently override environmental concerns, especially in developing countries where short-term needs take precedence over long-term sustainability.

Climate action also requires Global cooperation, but differing national interests and unequal capacities to respond make coordination difficult. Solving this challenge means increasing education and awareness, ensuring inclusive participation at all levels, and promoting equitable solutions that support both people and the planet.",0.7082627,0.08427751,0.47020698,0.8146344798128053,#f3a134

Ignorance even from global leaders affects the dissemination and trickling down of information to those being directly affected by climate change. We need to devise ways to properly communicate climate change and its effects to those who are affected the most. This means coming up with proven communication means to reach Africa whose contribution to climate change is minimal but is facing the biggest effects of climate change. We need to communicate more to the African population and set aside funds to help in climate change management.,0.5517783,0.23685777,0.5048963,0.6139780217695391,#f7e379
1880,"From my experience living in local villages in Malawi, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the lack of resources and support to help communities adapt and recover from disasters like floods and droughts. Many villagers depend on farming, but unpredictable weather patterns and extreme events destroy crops and homes, making it hard to survive. Without access to modern technology or early warning systems, we often remain unprepared when storms or dry spells hit.
Another major obstacle is limited education and awareness about climate change and how to protect our environment. People want to help but lack knowledge about sustainable farming, tree planting, or waste management. There is also insufficient government support and funding reaching rural areas for climate resilience projects, leaving villages vulnerable and struggling to rebuild.
As a young student from these communities, I believe empowering local villages with simple digital tools for tracking weather and sharing information can greatly improve preparedness. But real progress requires collaboration between local leaders, youth, and governments to provide education, finance, and infrastructure for sustainable lifestyles and disaster resilience. This challenge is urgent because our daily lives depend directly on the environment�s health.",0.49513507,0.51436204,0.34822357,0.6079094707045465,#f7e379
1881,"The most significant challenge for climate action today is the gap between scientific evidence and on-ground implementation. While our understanding of climate risks�such as extreme events, sea-level rise, and compound flooding�has improved greatly, this knowledge is not being translated quickly enough into policies, local planning, or community-level action.

This gap persists because implementation requires coordinated efforts across government agencies, researchers, communities, and funding institutions. In many vulnerable regions, these connections remain weak. As a result, even when strong scientific assessments exist, they often fail to influence land-use decisions, infrastructure planning, or ecosystem restoration efforts such as mangrove conservation.

The consequences are clear: climate impacts accelerate faster than our ability to respond. Communities continue to face high exposure, infrastructure remains unprepared, and ecosystem-based solutions are adopted too slowly to be effective.

Closing this gap requires mechanisms that bring science, policy, and community voices together�through co-created adaptation plans, better communication of risks, and capacity-building at local levels. If we can overcome this one barrier, climate action becomes more timely, inclusive, and impactful, ensuring that scientific insights drive real resilience on the ground.",0.6868906,0.21272993,0.7373574,0.7855347701603269,#f3a134
1882,"In my view, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the pervasive spread of greenwashing and misinformation, which erodes public trust and stifles collective mobilization. When corporations and governments promote superficial �green� initiatives that often mask continued fossil-fuel reliance or inadequate emissions reductions, people grow cynical and question the authenticity of all climate efforts. This distrust is further amplified by polarized media and algorithmic echo chambers that spread denialism, making it far harder to build consensus for bold policies. 
Recent assessments show that only 18% of the Sustainable Development Goals are on track to be met by 2030, due in part to lagging public engagement despite the urgency of the climate crisis. My PhD research on corporate sustainability communication and greenwashing illustrates this dynamic firsthand. Drawing on over 200 narratives from activists and consumers, I have observed how misleading claims trigger eco-anxiety, apathy, or backlash, slowing grassroots action.

Countries make ambitious pledges at COP negotiations, yet translating them into measurable progress remains slow. From my academic exposure to sustainability, production theory, and policy evaluation, I�ve learned that the core issue isn�t the lack of solutions�it�s the lack of coordinated execution, accountability, and long-term follow-through.

For developing nations, the challenge is intensified by limited climate finance, competing development priorities, and dependence on affordable fossil fuels. At the same time, advanced technologies like green hydrogen, large-scale storage, and carbon capture remain expensive and inaccessible, preventing the scale needed to reduce costs. This creates a cycle where high costs limit adoption, and limited adoption keeps costs high.

Most people know climate change is real, harmful, and urgent, but very few know what exactly to do in their daily lives and even fewer actually do it. This gap exists at every level: individual, community, corporate, and government.
Another major challenge is that climate solutions often sound expensive, complicated, or �too big� for people to relate to. When something feels out of reach, people naturally disconnect from it. At the same time, many sustainable alternatives are still not accessible or affordable for a large part of India. So even if someone wants to make a better choice, they might not have the option.
There�s also a lack of long-term thinking. Climate action is slow and invisible in the beginning, but people, institutions, and businesses often focus on short-term comfort or profit. This makes consistent action difficult.
Lastly, climate conversations sometimes feel like blame games who should do more, who polluted more when what we really need is shared responsibility and practical steps that people can understand and follow.

Without real-time, youth-friendly data, their innovations remain invisible to national NDC reports and global finance mechanisms.

Second, climate finance and trade rules are still misaligned with justice: highly exposed countries carry the heaviest adaptation burden while facing debt stress, high capital costs and complex, fragmented access procedures for funds. Third, communities most affected � informal workers, small farmers, women and youth � are rarely meaningfully included in designing solutions.

In my view, closing this implementation gap requires shifting incentives: phasing out fossil subsidies, de-risking green investment in the Global South, embedding loss and damage and adaptation into core economic planning, and hard-wiring participation and accountability into climate decisions. Without this political-economy shift, even the best technical strategies will remain pilots instead of the new normal.",0.32811165,0.4500594,0.7681966,0.7563952983148415,#f3a134
1911,"Since I belong from South Asia, Pakistan, and have witnessed the direct threat of global warming in forms of deadly floods, intense heatwaves and droughts, I believe one of the major challenge for climate action is bridging the gap between global policies and tangible implementation. 

Even after the signing the international treaty, Paris Agreement, the world is still behind to meet the 1.5�C goal. 
The main obstacle in achieving these targets are lack of funding for grassroot organisations, unequal distribution of resources and technology, insufficiency climate finance and lack of accountability from major emitters. 

If not addressed timely, these climate crisis will not only result in harming vulnerable communities, exacerbating poverty, displacement and inequality but also leave a lasting impact on big tanks.

To resolve and overcome these global warming issues, I strongly believe we need to focus on unified global action, increased accountability, and a planned transition to renewable energy that prioritizes the most affected.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the tension between rapid industrialisation and the slow transition to green, sustainable fuel sources. Many developing regions, especially in the Global South, are still in stages where industrial growth is directly tied to fossil fuel use. Coal, diesel and heavy industrial emissions remain deeply embedded in economic structures because they are affordable, familiar and readily available. As a result, industries continue to prioritise productivity and short-term profit over sustainability.

At the same time, the global shift toward green fuels�such as solar, wind, green hydrogen and bioenergy�faces high entry costs, limited technology transfer and inadequate investment. Although these alternatives offer long-term benefits, many economies struggle to adopt them due to weak infrastructure, funding gaps and insufficient policy incentives. This creates a major imbalance: countries need industrial growth to develop, yet the current model of industrialisation accelerates emissions and environmental degradation.

The biggest challenge, therefore, is finding a pathway where industrial development and green fuel adoption can advance together. Until green energy becomes accessible, affordable and scalable for all, climate action will continue to struggle against deeply rooted fossil-fuel-dependent industrial systems.",0.9160335,0.25144142,0.1494019,0.7341819181172021,#f3a134

I identify 'synergetic climate negotiations' and 'climate finance and governance' as the two most challenging aspects of climate action. Firstly, it is both very difficult and crucial to bring synergy between two mutually competing and clashing interests: developed vs. developing, industry/business vs. government, sustainability vs. development, and privileged vs. marginalized. Climate action requires a diplomatic balance between the two to agree on feasible steps towards climate sustainability. Any friction between the two sides can lead to the derailment of efforts, as seen in the case of the Paris Agreement and the climate finance commitments of different nations. Secondly, ensuring funds for climate action from those in better positions is a task that demands justifiable arguments and amicable negotiations to ensure success. Along with financial resources, the utilization and governance of finance is another very crucial aspect that demands attention. The most vulnerable sections of society must be treated with priority, who are inherently exposed to climate hazards due to their socio-economic circumstances. Hence, resource distribution must be prioritised based on the ground realities of climate vulnerability, so that the financial resources benefit the most disadvantaged sections. Hence, I view these two aspects as the greatest challenges in climate action today. ",0.64350176,0.45844072,0.62333226,0.7097411574834401,#f3a134

Another major challenge is inequality. Vulnerable communities, especially in countries like Tanzania, are disproportionately affected by climate change despite contributing the least. Limited resources, technical expertise, and infrastructure make adaptation and mitigation strategies harder to implement equitably.

Governments keep announcing targets instead of enforcing hard policies. Corporations make �net-zero� promises while continuing business as usual. And at the community level, people demand cleaner environments but resist even basic lifestyle or behavioural changes. This collective inconsistency delays action far more than scientific limitations.

Another major obstacle is 'the absence of accountability'. Climate commitments rarely come with penalties, so there�s no real pressure to deliver. Add to that misinformation, short-term economic thinking, and climate fatigue, and you get a world that talks a lot about climate action but moves painfully slowly.

Many countries and institutions make strong pledges�net-zero targets or climate financing promises�but these commitments often move slowly, lack clear timelines, or fail to reach the communities most affected by climate impacts.

This implementation gap is driven by several practical barriers: limited funding for local projects, weak coordination among government agencies, and inadequate technical capacity at community level. In many regions, policies are developed without fully considering the realities faced by rural communities, youth groups, or grassroots organisations. As a result, interventions become too slow, too small, or misaligned with the actual needs of the people facing climate issues.

Another part of the challenge is that climate impacts are escalating faster than the systems designed to respond. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, yet disaster preparedness, early warning systems, and climate education are still underdeveloped in many vulnerable countries.

Justice Deficit- The demand for minerals essential for European green energy (e.g., cobalt, copper) results in environmental degradation and displacement, directly undermining the human rights of vulnerable communities on the ground.

Accountability Failure- National legal and regulatory frameworks in the South lack the capacity or political will to enforce corporate criminal liability for these environmental crimes, rendering international climate policy toothless at the local level.

While global discussions focus on policies and technology, many people, especially refugees, displaced populations, and low-income communities, lack access to information, funding, and sustainable solutions.

In refugee settlements, I have seen how unpredictable rains, soil degradation, and limited land access make it nearly impossible for families to grow food sustainably. Even when solutions exist, lack of awareness, education, or financial support prevents them from implementing these practices. This creates a cycle where those most affected by climate change are least able to protect themselves and their environment.

Addressing this challenge requires inclusive, community-driven approaches. Climate action must involve those directly impacted, empowering them with knowledge, resources, and practical tools. Youth leadership, local innovation, and partnerships between governments, NGOs, and communities are key to bridging this gap.

Through my work with the Refugee With Potential Foundation, I train refugees in climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable practices. By empowering marginalized communities, I believe we can strengthen local resilience and contribute to a more equitable and effective global response to climate change.",0.36799765,0.5764288,0.6361283,0.6068302880544985,#f7e379

As a young leader from Nigeria, I bring an essential perspective on climate justice and adaptation challenges. 

I aim to engage with high-level policymakers and researchers not just to network, but to genuinely understand the legislative mechanisms that influence climate finance and regulation. And the Ideas Lab�s emphasis on interdisciplinary dialogue is vital. I want to leave Brussels with a refined framework for my advocacy, enabling me to develop durable, scalable, and equitable climate solutions for my Organization, community, and the world at large. 

Eventually, I will use the insights gained to strengthen cooperation�drive policy changes that directly benefit vulnerable communities in my home country�starting with my neighborhood.

1942,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening gap between global climate commitments and the realities faced by vulnerable communities, especially in the Global South. While policies and financing frameworks continue to advance, the communities most affected by droughts, floods, and extreme heat often lack the resources, technologies, and support systems needed to adapt.

This gap is fueled by three issues: inequitable access to climate finance, which leaves low-capacity communities without the funds to implement local solutions; a disconnect between policy design and community realities, leading to interventions that do not reflect cultural or socioeconomic contexts; and the limited inclusion of youth, women, and indigenous people, who are closest to climate impacts but often excluded from decision-making.

If these barriers persist, climate action will remain fragmented and insufficient. Real progress requires locally led, inclusive, and adequately financed solutions. Strengthening grassroots innovations, improving access to adaptation resources, and equipping young people with green skills are essential.

This is the gap I am working to close through SolarRain+ at MUMSA Initiative and all my climate resilience programs.",0.5775912,0.5393411,0.9322145,0.6837565681024519,#f7e379
1943,"In my opinion, the most significant challenge for climate action today is not a lack of solutions, but the gap between scientific knowledge and real-world implementation. We already have the technologies needed: renewables, storage, efficiency systems, and emerging solutions like green hydrogen. The real barrier is the combination of political hesitation, slow policy adoption, and fragmented global coordination.
Many governments still struggle to align long-term climate goals with short-term economic and political pressures. This results in delayed policies, inconsistent regulations, and underinvestment in clean energy infrastructure. At the same time, vulnerable communities often lack access to the resources necessary for participating in the transition, which creates inequitable progress across different regions.
Additionally, misinformation and low public understanding of climate trade-offs make it difficult to build the societal consensus required for ambitious action.
In summary, the greatest challenge is to turn proven climate solutions into large-scale, coordinated, and equitable implementations. Overcoming this challenge requires political will, stronger public engagement, and sustained global cooperation to ensure that climate action transitions from plans and pathways into urgent, transformative change.",0.7278478,0.28971565,0.40837216,0.8524863331634989,#e51f1f

Many people understand that climate change is a threat, but this knowledge rarely becomes sustained behavior change or strong pressure for policy improvements. 

A major reason is that climate communication often remains too technical, making the issues feel distant from daily life, especially in communities facing economic or social pressures. 

There is also a disconnect between global climate solutions and local realities, which makes some initiatives feel imposed rather than shaped with community input. 

In addition, limited funding and weak political will slow progress, particularly in countries most vulnerable to climate impacts.

While most governments, institutions, and communities understand the urgency of the climate crisis, translating commitments into practical, sustained, and well-funded action remains difficult.
A major reason for this is the lack of equitable resources and capacities, especially in developing countries.

Many countries have strong plans and targets, but the systems to turn these commitments into tangible, local impact remain weak, especially in financing, policy, and technology deployment.

In countries like Nigeria, affordable and accessible financing is a major barrier. Clean energy solutions exist, but they often remain out oaf reach because investors see rural or low-income communities as high risk. This slows renewable energy projects, adaptation efforts, and climate-resilient development. Without the right financing models, even the best ideas cannot scale.

Climate action is also often designed far from the people most affected. Policies are made at the global level, but realities on the ground are shaped by poverty, weak institutions, and social inequities. In rural Nigeria, high electricity tariffs limit access to solar mini-grids, showing that climate solutions must meet people�s real needs.

Finally, lack of trust and coordination across countries slows collective progress. Climate impacts do not respect borders, but our actions often do. For climate action to succeed, we need inclusive financing, community-grounded policies, and global cooperation that matches the scale of the challenge.",0.5602386,0.61497104,0.52538836,0.7779582061042631,#f3a134
1948,"The biggest challenge is the gap between global climate knowledge and local climate realities. The world has advanced climate models, research, and strategies, but most vulnerable communities still lack the most basic real-time information they need to stay safe. Climate action suffers when people cannot act on data they do not have or cannot understand.

Another challenge is that climate conversations feel too abstract for many. Communities care about daily survival, not long policy documents. If climate action does not connect directly to food security, flooding, health, mobility, or income, it simply does not gain adoption.

Financing is also uneven. Billions are pledged globally, yet grassroots adaptation projects struggle to receive even small amounts. The funding mismatch slows innovation and prevents scalable solutions from reaching places where they are needed most.

Lastly, climate action often ignores local context. Solutions designed for Europe or North America do not translate cleanly to African cities with informal settlements, limited infrastructure, and unreliable power. We need hyper-local, community-driven, culturally grounded approaches.

Until we close these gaps in data access, trust, financing, and contextual relevance, climate action will remain slower than the pace of climate change.",0.7534306,0.43810785,0.9029155,0.7983053015099147,#f3a134
1949,"I personally think that one of the biggest challenges for climate action today, particularly in Africa, is the low level of climate awareness and literacy among citizens, local policymakers, and businesses. While global conversations focus on climate finance and technology transfer, many local communities remain uninformed or disengaged from climate discourse. They do not understand the causes, consequences, or opportunities of climate change within their own communities.
In Africa, climate discussions remain confined to government offices, international forums, or donor-driven projects, with little translation into local languages or daily realities. This knowledge gap means that people who experience the harshest effects of drought, flooding, or waste mismanagement are often excluded from shaping or benefiting from climate solutions. Without broad-based understanding, even the most well-designed national adaptation plans struggle to gain traction at the grassroots level.
From my experience in sustainability and stakeholder engagement, I have seen that awareness is the foundation of action. When people understand how climate change connects to their livelihoods through agriculture, waste, or energy, they become active participants rather than passive beneficiaries.
To achieve impactful climate action, Africa needs more than policies; it needs inclusive education, community engagement, and accessible communication that empower citizens to co-create solutions.

1951,"In my view, the greatest challenge in climate action today is ensuring that solutions are truly owned by local populations, particularly Indigenous communities.

Too often, climate projects are driven by external actors and constrained by short-term funding cycles. However, once the funding ends, it is the communities that remain, sometimes with the tools to continue the work, but often without.

That is why it is essential for local populations to become the main drivers of climate action. When communities are fully aware of environmental challenges and equipped with the right knowledge and practices, they can ensure the long-term sustainability of these efforts.

From the outset, climate initiatives must be built on a sustainable vision, rooted in the culture, knowledge, and needs of the people involved. True sustainability cannot exist without a transfer of ownership, local engagement, and a deep understanding of the purpose behind the actions being taken, so that they can be passed on to future generations.",0.39965844,0.65592074,0.59439206,0.5914947525884834,#f7e379

While climate goals, frameworks, and declarations continue to grow, many countries still lack the financial resources, technological capacity, and political stability needed to turn those commitments into action. This imbalance leaves vulnerable communities carrying the greatest burden despite contributing the least to the problem. Another major challenge is that climate solutions are often designed without considering local realities. For many African countries, including Botswana, issues such as energy access, waste management, drought, and economic dependence on extractive industries are deeply interconnected. Climate action must therefore address development needs and create livelihoods, not just reduce emissions. Finally, unequal access to funding and decision-making remains a barrier. Countries like Botswana need support to build research capacity, deploy renewable energy technologies, and transition to circular, resilient economies. Without fair financing structures and genuine inclusion of Global South voices in climate policy conversations, global progress will remain slow and uneven. The greatest challenge is not a lack of ideas, it is ensuring that climate solutions are inclusive, adequately funded, and aligned with the needs of communities most affected.",0.7830355,0.40103352,0.55391145,0.7667421667783765,#f3a134

While we have unprecedented knowledge of climate risks and proven mitigation and adaptation strategies, translating these into actionable, locally appropriate solutions remains a major obstacle. 

Another critical challenge is ensuring equity in climate action. Vulnerable communities, especially in rural areas, are disproportionately affected by floods, droughts, and extreme weather, yet they often have the least voice in decision-making. Climate policies and initiatives risk being ineffective or even exclusionary if they fail to center these communities� priorities and local knowledge.

Finally, coordination across sectors and scales is difficult. Climate action requires collaboration among governments, civil society, researchers, and the private sector. Misaligned priorities, bureaucracy, and fragmented planning slow down urgent responses and reduce the impact of interventions.

1954,"The biggest challenge is the disconnect between those who understand climate urgency and those building the technology that impacts it most.

I see this in my daily work as an AI Engineer and a community developer. We're developing increasingly powerful AI systems that consume massive amounts of energy, yet sustainability is treated as a nice-to-have, not a requirement. We're building tools that could help solve climate problems while our data centers and model training accelerate the very problem we're trying to fix.

This is especially acute in Asia, where sustainability often loses out to rapid innovation and economic growth. Countries are racing to build AI capabilities and digital infrastructure, rarely stopping to ask: what's the environmental cost? There are fewer regulations, less emphasis on green technology, and innovation is pursued at almost any price.

Singapore is a perfect example, we're aggressively building a Smart Nation while being one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the region.

We live in an era where climate science is advanced, and technologies for mitigation and adaptation exist, yet action remains uneven, delayed, and often disconnected from lived realities. This gap is driven by what I describe as the �Data Cantillon Effect� � where early access to data, predictive tools, and decision-making infrastructure gives some regions a disproportionate adaptive advantage, while vulnerable communities remain excluded from shaping their own climate futures.

Climate action is further constrained by siloed governance, short political cycles, and a failure to treat communities as co-creators rather than beneficiaries. Policies designed at global or national levels often struggle to translate into locally trusted, context-sensitive interventions, eroding legitimacy and slowing implementation.

The true challenge, therefore, is not only reducing emissions but redesigning climate systems to be participatory, equitable, and accountable where data is decentralised, decision-making is shared, and communities have agency over the transitions that affect their land, livelihoods, and identities.

Until climate governance bridges this divide between expertise and lived experience, ambition and implementation, our response will remain technically sophisticated but socially fragile.

1956,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening gap between global decision making and the lived realities of frontline communities. Policies are shaped in spaces far removed from where climate impacts actually unfold, which means the urgency felt in places like Pakistan rarely translates into adequate support or financing. This disconnect is clearest during Pakistan�s recurring floods. Entire villages are swept away, families are displaced overnight, yet global conversations still move slowly, with limited attention to climate induced displacement or the gendered nature of climate vulnerability.

Another challenge is that the Global South continues to bear the brunt of climate impacts without having real leverage in setting global priorities. Even critical mechanisms like adaptation finance or loss and damage remain underfunded. From my experience in flood hit areas, I�ve seen how communities rebuild with almost no institutional support, relying instead on local solidarity. This is not sustainable, and it reflects a broader failure of climate governance.

Communities often understand the risks but lack institutional support to adopt sustainable alternatives.

My training in Public Policy and Management (Certification) from IIM (Indian Institute of Management) Kozhikode made me realise that the core challenge is not just technology or awareness, but the absence of coherent, inclusive, and actionable policy frameworks that translate climate commitments into ground-level change.

Yet the systems built around them rarely start from their experiences, fears, or ways of understanding the problem at hand. 

This disconnection creates a larger problem: climate action becomes technical before it becomes human. The focus moves quickly to infrastructure, technology and financing models, while the everyday skills and emotional resilience that communities rely on, especially women and children, remain unaddressed. 

Another challenge is that climate impacts do not arrive in isolation. They come layered with inequality, education gaps, mental health stress and limited access to information. For instance, in many schools we visit, climate events interrupt learning repeatedly, but teachers have no tools to support students through the aftermath.

We already understand the causes of climate change and have many proven solutions�renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable land use, and early warning systems. However, translating this knowledge into coordinated, on-ground action remains difficult due to several interconnected barriers.
One major issue is lack of policy consistency and global cooperation. While climate impacts are global, responses are often fragmented, short-term, and influenced by political or economic pressures. Climate change is a fast-growing socio-ecological crisis needing coordinated action across sectors.
Similarly, insufficient funding and slow technology adoption limit the ability of vulnerable regions�especially developing countries�to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies at the required scale.
Another critical challenge is the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, which are outpacing our capacity to adapt. Farmers, ecosystems, and communities are struggling to cope with unpredictable rainfall, heat waves, and flooding, such as the waterlogging issues I explored in my own research.

Climate finance remains far below what vulnerable countries and communities actually need, and even when funding exists, it is often slow, bureaucratic, and hard for the countries and individuals to access, especially at local level. At the same time, many of these countries are trapped by debt and high borrowing costs, which means they are forced to choose between servicing debt and investing in resilience, clean energy, and basic services. On top of this, governments continue to approve and subsidize new fossil fuel projects while making huge climate promises on paper, so there is a constant gap between what science demands and what politics delivers, particularly when it comes to phasing out fossil fuels in a fair way.

Although many governments and communities understand the urgency of the climate crisis, translating commitments into practical, well-funded, and sustained action remains limited. This gap is driven by several factors: insufficient financing for adaptation, slow policy execution, and competing economic pressures that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability.

In many developing countries, communities are already experiencing severe climate impacts, yet they lack the resources, technology, and institutional capacity to respond effectively. Even where solutions exist, such as renewable energy, climate-smart agriculture, or early-warning systems, their adoption is often slowed by limited funding, weak coordination, and a lack of public awareness.

Another major challenge is the unequal distribution of responsibility. While vulnerable communities suffer the most, they contribute the least to global emissions. Meanwhile, global cooperation is often hindered by political interests and inconsistent climate commitments from major emitters.

1976,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. While many people understand that climate change is real and urgent, translating this awareness into consistent, collective action remains difficult. This gap is driven by several interconnected issues.

First, limited access to climate education and accurate information prevents communities�especially those in developing regions�from fully understanding how climate change affects their daily lives. Without this understanding, climate action is often seen as abstract or secondary to immediate survival needs.

Second, weak policy enforcement and inadequate political will slow down progress. Many governments have climate policies on paper, but poor implementation, corruption, and competing priorities prevent meaningful action. As a result, communities remain vulnerable to floods, erosion, heatwaves, and other climate impacts.

Another major challenge is insufficient funding and resources for grassroots initiatives. Local communities are often the ones most affected by climate change, yet they lack the financial and technical support needed to build resilience or adopt sustainable practices.

Finally, behavioral change remains difficult. People may resist shifting from harmful habits like indiscriminate waste disposal or heavy reliance on fossil fuels because alternatives seem inconvenient or costly.

This creates tension between development needs and climate commitments. Communities want change, but they also want jobs, stable energy supply, and opportunities to participate meaningfully in the transition.

Another major barrier is access to finance especially for youth, women, and small businesses trying to innovate in areas like waste management, circular economy, or renewable energy. Without inclusive funding and capacity-building, climate action remains concentrated in the hands of a few.

Lastly, there is a communication challenge. Many people still see climate action as technical or distant from their everyday lives. We need simpler, community-driven messaging and stronger education so people can understand, support, and benefit from climate solutions.

Geographically, Ghana spans from a densely populated coast to a drought-prone north. This makes us a microcosm of Africa�s worst climate impacts. Rising sea levels are causing rapid coastal erosion, directly threatening communities, critical infrastructure like the Takoradi port, and the livelihoods of millions. Simultaneously, erratic rainfall and prolonged droughts in our northern regions devastate rain-fed agriculture, our economic backbone, leading to food insecurity and displacing rural populations.

This geographical duality creates a perfect storm. It stretches our limited resources thin, forcing us to fight a war on two fronts: against the sea in the south and the desert in the north. The core challenge is that these geographically-determined impacts are not future threats; they are current, active emergencies that undermine development and stability faster than we can build resilient systems. Our location makes us a climate frontline state, and our greatest struggle is mobilizing sufficient resources and international support to build walls against the sea and resilience against the drought at the same time.",0.67478323,0.4469155,0.40707827,0.5552203882496074,#f7e379

People cut down trees for charcoal, they overuse land, or continue harmful farming practices, not because they want to destroy the planet, but because they need income and do not have better options. This makes climate action difficult, especially in developing countries like Malawi, because people must choose between protecting nature and feeding their families.

Another major challenge is the lack of information. Many people do not fully understand how serious climate change is or how their daily activities contribute to the problem. Without awareness, it is hard for communities to change habits or support climate-friendly solutions.

Access to resources is also limited. Climate projects often require funding, training, and tools, yet many young leaders and small communities cannot access these opportunities. As a result, good ideas remain small, and the full potential for climate action is not reached.

Finally, climate change is a global problem, but our efforts are often disconnected. Organisations, and communities work separately instead of together, which slows down progress.

These impacts create urgency, yet the systems meant to respond often lack the resources and coordination needed to act quickly.
During my heat stress work in Patna, this challenge was very clear. The data showed rising temperatures and highlighted high-risk neighbourhoods, and community members shared how heat affected their health and daily routines. Even with strong evidence, translating it into action was difficult because local institutions were overstretched and needed more support than was available. It made me realise that knowledge alone cannot drive climate action without practical capacity on the ground.
Another challenge is that climate finance remains complex and inaccessible for many local actors. City departments and community organisations often struggle to meet the requirements needed to access funds, even when their needs are urgent.

A major driver of this gap is insufficient climate finance and inequitable access to funding. Many developing countries and grassroots organisations struggle to access funds that would enable them to build resilience, invest in clean energy, strengthen early warning systems, and support climate-smart agriculture. Even when funds exist, bureaucratic processes, limited capacity, and slow disbursement hinder impact.

Another key challenge is the disconnect between policy and people. Climate policies are often designed at high levels but rarely reach the communities most affected by climate change.

Yet action often moves slowly because climate issues are treated as distant, technical or someone else�s responsibility.
Another challenge is that the communities most affected, especially in the Global South, rarely have a seat at the table. Growing up and working in Syria and Lebanon, I�ve seen coastal communities struggle with pollution, habitat loss and economic pressure, while decisions about climate and sustainability are often made far away and without their voices. This disconnect limits the relevance and impact of climate policies on the ground.
I also believe climate action suffers from being fragmented. Scientists, policymakers, businesses and local communities often work in parallel rather than together. In my work whether removing ghost nets, restoring seagrass or communicating PFAS risks, I�ve seen how powerful it can be when people collaborate instead of acting in isolation.

But there's also a deeper, more human challenge: it feels to many like climate action is something ""experts"" do, not something they can shape. Communities don't always have access to information, or trust in institutions, or real opportunities to participate. When people don't feel ownership, even good policies struggle to take root. The real barrier, to me, is this lack of shared agency. We cannot solve a global problem when most people feel like bystanders.

Climate variability, increasing frequency of extreme weather events, and shifting rainfall patterns threaten food security, livelihoods, and the sustainability of farming systems worldwide (Verma et al., 2025). Developing countries are disproportionately affected, as they often rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture and have limited access to resources, technology, and infrastructure necessary for adaptation. Despite significant international commitments, adaptation finance remains insufficient. The IPCC (2023) notes that adaptation needs are now 10 to 18 times higher than current global finance flows, leaving many vulnerable communities unable to invest in resilience, sustainable food systems, or disaster preparedness. Similarly, the UNCCD (2022) emphasizes that land degradation and desertification exacerbate climate risks, further undermining agricultural productivity and livelihoods.

For instance, in Delhi, despite a reported 25% green cover, the neighborhoods experiencing extreme heat, air pollution, and flooding are often those with the least resources and political recognition. These disparities remain obscured when assessments depend solely on aggregated data.
Furthermore, the exclusion of affected communities from climate decision-making hinders progress.

While countries, institutions, and industries widely acknowledge the urgency of the climate crisis, progress is slowed by limited political will and inadequate financing.
This implementation gap is visible in developing countries, where climate impacts are most severe but resources and institutional capacity are limited. Communities that contribute the least to global emissions face the harshest consequences, yet they lack access to climate finance, technology, and infrastructure needed to adapt. This creates a cycle where vulnerability deepens, and climate action becomes increasingly difficult.

2000,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the insufficient integration of climate and environmental concerns into economic and development planning. While climate action in different countries face different obstacles ranging from technological transitions to resource scarcity. The common challenge is that climate is still treated as externality not as an integral structural risk to the economy.
For instance, In Malawi each year, despite recurrent climate shocks that devastate agriculture, disrupt energy supply, and strain fiscal stability climate change is often addressed as a sectoral issue rather than being mainstreamed in macroeconomic frameworks. 
Furthermore, most convectional models used treat environmental damage as a market failure instead of mainstreaming it in planning and economic frameworks. This leads to climate policies remaining fragmented and underfunded. Adaptation measures such as early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, become sidelined because they are not integrated into budgets or public investment strategies. This leaves countries like Malawi dependent on external finance and trapped in cycles of vulnerability.
Ultimately, climate action requires deliberate prioritization of resources within planning models and frameworks. Without integrating climate into the heart of fiscal and macroeconomic planning, policies will remain paper commitments.

While climate goals are clear, many vulnerable populations still lack access to clean energy, climate finance, technology, and reliable information.
This creates a cycle where people are aware of climate risks but lack the means to change their daily practices�especially in energy, agriculture, transport, and waste management. The clean energy transition remains slow because solutions are often expensive, not adapted to local cultures, or disconnected from community priorities.
Another major challenge is limited inclusion of young people in climate decision-making, despite youth being key drivers of innovation and community mobilization.
To overcome these challenges, climate action must become more just, accessible, and locally driven. Community-based innovation�like affordable clean cooking solutions�should be supported through financing, capacity building, and policy incentives.

I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real action. While many people are aware of climate change and its impacts, this awareness does not always translate into meaningful, coordinated, and sustained action. Factors such as limited resources, lack of access to accurate information, and economic pressures often prevent communities especially in developing countries rom prioritizing climate solutions.

Another major challenge is the unequal impact of climate change. Communities that contribute the least to global emissions are often the most affected by extreme weather events, food insecurity, and water shortages. This creates frustration and a sense of injustice, which can reduce trust in climate policies and global commitments.

Additionally, weak implementation of climate policies and limited involvement of local communities slow progress. Many climate solutions are designed at high levels without fully considering local contexts and knowledge, making them difficult to implement effectively on the ground.

To overcome these challenges, climate action must be inclusive, practical, and community-driven. Empowering local leaders, investing in education, and providing affordable, accessible solutions can help bridge the gap between awareness and action. Strong collaboration between governments, communities, and young people is essential to ensure that climate commitments lead impact.

Many people understand the urgency of climate change, yet communities in the Global South, where I come from, face the most immediate and severe impacts. Young people, migrants and marginalised groups often feel powerless to influence policies or industry practices, despite being disproportionately affected.

Fragmentation across climate efforts makes progress harder. Scientists, policymakers, educators and activists often work in isolation, limiting solutions that are practical and culturally relevant. My experience working across South Asia and Europe has shown how powerful change can be when communities are engaged, knowledge is shared across borders and local voices shape decisions. Scaling these approaches remains a key challenge.

Equity is central. Climate action frequently overlooks those without access, resources or influence, leaving vulnerable communities behind. I am committed to ensuring sustainability education and empowerment reach everyone and that solutions reflect diverse experiences, particularly those from the Global South.

Addressing these challenges requires collaboration and creativity. Knowledge of climate's reality and awareness is where the power is and that needs to be channelled into action.

Urban and industrial communities particularly lack awareness about waste management's climate impact, meaning initiatives in biogas, clean cooking, and waste-to-energy remain underutilized despite their tremendous potential. 
Technical capacity presents another critical barrier. Limited knowledge about climate mitigation technologies hinders adoption of proven solutions like biogas digesters and mushroom cultivation from agricultural waste, while skills training programs rarely reach the communities that need them most. Infrastructure deficits further exacerbate the problem insufficient recycling facilities, landfills, and waste-to-energy plants mean organic waste that could be valuable for biogas and biofertilizer ends up decomposing in open dumps, releasing methane. Financial constraints limit access to climate finance, preventing small-scale entrepreneurs and municipalities from investing in clean cooking technologies and waste processing equipment.

Many countries make big climate promises, but real action is slow, especially in places that are already suffering the most. In Somalia, communities face drought, floods, deforestation, poor waste systems, and coastal destruction, yet the resources to protect people are very limited. 
Another challenge is that climate finance does not reach vulnerable countries quickly or fairly.   Countries like Somalia contribute almost nothing to global emissions, but they experience the harshest impacts.   Funding processes are slow, complicated, and often controlled by people far away from the communities that need urgent support. There is also a lack of awareness and education at the community level.   Many people simply do not have access to the knowledge, tools, or opportunities to take part in climate solutions.   When people are struggling with daily survival, climate issues can feel distant, even when they affect everyday life. 

Finally, young people are rarely given the space they deserve.   Youth have the energy and ideas needed for change, but they are often left out of important decisions.

We have strong goal-setting frameworks: NDCs, net-zero pledges, and major finance promises. Yet turning these into tangible action remains difficult because of three interconnected barriers.
First, climate finance rarely reaches those who need it most. Despite the $100 billion pledge, accessing funds, especially for adaptation remains complex and bureaucratic. Local actors who best understand community needs are often excluded. Even the historic loss and damage fund agreed at COP27 is progressing slowly while vulnerable communities face escalating disasters.
Second, climate action often lacks real local ownership. Solutions are still designed in global capitals and exported to places like Dhaka or Lagos. Without meaningful participation from women, indigenous groups, and marginalized communities, interventions fail to address actual vulnerabilities or build long-term resilience.
Third, climate change is still treated as an isolated environmental issue. Institutional silos and fragmented funding prevent integrated approaches that link climate with development, health, inequality, and justice.

We have global targets, national pledges, and a steady flow of climate conversations, but the people and systems that live with the impact of climate change every day rarely see those plans translate into real support.

What this really means is that climate policy often moves faster than the capacity of local governments, communities, and small industries to implement it. Waste management, adaptation, and resilience work especially suffer from this gap. Municipal teams lack resources, informal workers are left out of planning, and frontline communities don�t get the information or tools they need to adapt. So even strong policies end up stuck between intent and impact.

Another challenge is that climate action is still framed as a technical issue rather than a social one. Behaviour change, trust-building, and local ownership don�t get the same attention as infrastructure or technology, even though they decide whether any intervention will last.

Many people still underestimate the urgency of climate change or view it as a distant problem due to lack of awareness and behavioral change. This stalls adoption of sustainable practices, reduces community participation and political pressure for strong climate policies.

Furthermore, funding remains a factor, especially for early-stage innovators and developing countries facing different climate change related problems. Without adequate investment, many transformative ideas cannot scale.

Finally, climate action suffers from pooly aligned efforts to curb the challenge. Governments, private sectors, researchers, and communities often work in isolation, leading to repitition of idea instead of shared progress.

Equity is also a major issue. Vulnerable communities are often the most affected by climate impacts but have the least resources to adapt. Without approaches that center local voices, policies risk being ineffective or even counterproductive.
Another challenge is the lack of integration across sectors like energy, transportation, agriculture, and urban planning. Many initiatives operate in silos, which reduces efficiency and misses opportunities for co-benefits like jobs, better health, or stronger community resilience.

Fossil fuel combustion accounts for roughly 73% of global greenhouse gas emissions, driving warming, ecosystem collapse, and climate disasters. This challenge spans both supply, with continued industrial extraction, and demand, with global reliance on fossil fuels.

Even as grassroots communities, governments, and global actors advance solutions through renewable energy projects, nature-based interventions, and climate policies, the scale and persistence of fossil fuel dependence make meaningful climate action extremely difficult. Economic incentives continue to favor short-term profit over long-term ecological and social well-being, slowing the adoption of clean energy and low-carbon alternatives.

Addressing this challenge requires systemic shifts: scaling renewable energy infrastructure, reforming policies that subsidize fossil fuels, incentivizing sustainable technologies, and driving behavioral change among consumers. Tackling both the supply and demand of fossil fuels is essential to ensure that climate solutions are feasible, scalable, and timely.

While wealthy nations set net-zero targets, they maintain systems of extraction that make genuine climate action by developing countries impossible.

The EU's emissions cuts pressure Global South nations to abandon development pathways despite their negligible historical emissions. Meanwhile, corporations outsource carbon-intensive production to India and Bangladesh, laundering their footprints.

This gap between policy and lived experience is fatal. During my fieldwork in South Africa, farmers revealed how top-down strategies ignore ground realities.

International agreements set ambitious targets, yet smallholder farmers, displaced communities, and vulnerable youth often lack the resources or knowledge to implement sustainable solutions. In many Nigerian communities, overuse of chemical fertilizers continues because safer alternatives are unavailable or unknown, causing soil degradation and health risks.

Youth engagement is also limited. Young people inherit the consequences of climate inaction but are often excluded from decision making, mentorship, and funding opportunities. Local initiatives struggle to scale or gain visibility despite innovative solutions.

Finally, lack of funding and capacity limits the impact of grassroots projects. Bridging this gap requires collaboration between communities, policymakers, researchers, and global networks. Solutions like probiotics for safer farming, combined with global support and youth empowerment, can make climate action more inclusive, effective, and resilient.

Ethiopia's climate crisis is a water crisis. We face a paradox of intense floods and prolonged droughts, directly threatening water security. My research on the Haramaya Town water supply exposed how existing infrastructure is critically vulnerable to these climate shocks. While national policies and international agreements exist, there is a profound implementation gap. Top down approaches often fail to integrate community specific knowledge and the precise hydrological data needed for resilient engineering. The challenge is one of equity and granularity. We need climate finance and technology transfer directed not just to nations, but to local projects that build resilience from the ground up. This means designing water supply systems based on projected climate scenarios, managing watersheds to combat erosion from intense rains, and creating adaptive waste management for flood affected areas.

Second, institutional fragmentation prevents action; successful adaptation requires integrating siloed sectors, land use, environmental science, and public finance, preventing the cohesive adoption of interdisciplinary strategies like Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). Finally, issues of equity and justice mean that current climate action often prioritises large-scale infrastructure, systematically bypassing vulnerable, informal settlements where tenure is insecure, and access to finance is nonexistent.

Many people, especially in underserved areas, simply do not know how their daily habits connect to the larger climate crisis. It is not that they do not care, it is that no one has ever explained the consequences in a way that feels real to them.

I have seen people burn waste, pour chemicals into the soil, or block drainage channels with refuse, not out of neglect but because they do not understand the long-term impact. When people do not see the link between these actions and flooding, pollution, Heat, Contaminated water, or health problems, climate action becomes something �far away,� something meant for big cities or global conferences�not their everyday lives.

Another challenge is that climate education often focuses on technical language that ordinary people cannot relate to. Without simple explanations and practical alternatives, it becomes difficult for communities to change old habits.

What I have learned is that climate action cannot succeed if it stays at the policy level alone. It needs to start with people, helping them understand how the environment affects their health, income, safety, and future. If this gap in awareness is not addressed, even the best policies will not achieve their full impact.

Plus, there's a lot of misinformation out there, and it's tough to know what's true and what's not.

Another major issue is the lack of collective action. Climate change is a global problem, but it's hard to get everyone to work together towards a common goal. Politics, economics, and social differences often get in the way, and it's tough to prioritize the planet's well-being over individual interests.

I think the biggest challenge is mindset. We need to shift from seeing climate action as an environmental issue to seeing it as a human issue. We need to understand that our daily choices have an impact on people, communities, and the planet. We need to take ownership of our actions and demand more from our leaders.

I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is global cooperation and collective action. Climate change is a global problem that requires countries, organizations and individuals to work together towards common goals. However, differing priorities, interests and levels of commitment can make it difficult to achieve consensus and implement effective climate policies.

Additionally, overcoming misinformation and skepticism about climate change is crucial. Many people still doubt the severity of climate change or its human causes which can hinder efforts to build support for climate action.

Accelerating the transition to renewable energy is also essential. This requires rapidly scaling up renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

Lastly, addressing climate justice and equity is vital. Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities and it's essential to prioritize their needs and ensure that climate action is fair and equitable.

Another critical challenge is engaging youth and local communities meaningfully in climate decision-making. Many young people are highly motivated and willing to contribute to solutions, yet they frequently lack access to platforms, funding, and technical knowledge that would enable them to transform ideas into action.

This creates significant political and social resistance, particularly in developing countries reliant on natural resources for development and social spending. The transition must be perceived as not only environmentally necessary but also economically viable and socially just. Simply put, we lack sufficiently robust and politically palatable mechanisms to make sustainable choices the most attractive option in the short run for key actors�from governments and corporations to individual consumers and voters.

Overcoming this requires moving beyond siloed solutions. We need integrated policies that combine carbon pricing with massive investment in green technologies, active labor market policies for reskilling, and targeted support for vulnerable communities and sectors.

I believe the biggest overarching challenge for climate action today is the disconnect between high-level ambition and equitable, accelerated financing for adaptation and mitigation in the Global South.
While political momentum has grown, the delivery of promised climate finance�specifically the \$100 billion commitment and beyond�remains inadequate and often slow. This failure directly hinders the capacity of climate-vulnerable nations, particularly in Africa, to implement critical adaptation measures and transition to cleaner energy sources.
The challenge is threefold:
 * Equity and Justice: Climate impacts are disproportionately felt by the poor and marginalized. Action fails if it does not prioritize vulnerable communities and address the structural inequalities that exacerbate their exposure.
 * Implementation Gap: There is a significant gap between pledging and tangible project execution. This is often tied to complex bureaucratic procedures and a lack of risk-sharing mechanisms from developed nations.
 * Political Will vs. Short-Term Economics: Governments often prioritize short-term economic gains and domestic political cycles over the necessary, long-term, and potentially unpopular structural reforms required for a deep decarbonization transition.

This disconnect slows down global and local progress, making climate action uneven and insufficient.

Part of the problem lies in communication. For years, climate advocacy relied heavily on scientific and political language that many ordinary citizens find difficult to relate to their daily lives. People hear about melting ice caps and rising temperatures but rarely understand how these changes influence their livelihoods. As a result, climate change is acknowledged but not internalized.

Economic challenges deepen this gap. In many communities, especially in developing countries, families struggling with poverty often prioritize survival over environmental protection.

These existing vulnerabilities make them disproportionately exposed during climate disasters, and yet their realities are rarely acknowledged in climate policy, adaptation strategies, or global negotiations.

Despite this, LGBTQIA+ youth are active contributors to environmental protection; participating in clean-ups, tree-planting, community education, and organizing local resilience initiatives. However, their leadership often goes unseen due to social stigma and their limited access to formal decision-making spaces. When the people who face the greatest risk are invisible in climate conversations, solutions become less equitable and less effective.

The challenge, therefore, is not only climate change itself but the lack of an intersectional approach that integrates human rights, social inclusion, and climate justice.

Many people understand that climate change is a problem, yet translating that awareness into consistent, community-wide behavioural change remains difficult.

First, �limited access to climate education��especially in developing regions�prevents people from understanding how their daily actions impact the environment. Without practical knowledge, it becomes difficult for individuals and communities to adopt sustainable practices such as proper waste disposal, reduced burning, or responsible consumption.

Second, �economic constraints� make climate-friendly choices seem expensive or inconvenient. In many communities, people rely on practices like open burning or single-use plastics because they are cheaper or more accessible than sustainable alternatives. Climate solutions often require long-term investment, but many households are focused on immediate survival.

Third, �weak policy enforcement� reduces accountability. Even where environmental laws exist, enforcement is inconsistent, making harmful practices more common and reducing incentives for systematic change.

Technological innovation, population growth, and economic development continue at a rapid pace, yet these advances can intensify vulnerabilities in regions lacking infrastructure, governance capacity, or financial resources to adapt to escalating climate hazards.

For many climate-vulnerable communities, the gap between opportunity and risk is widening. Recurrent disasters, poor planning, and inequitable policies often force populations to absorb risks they did not create (social distribution of bads). Global growth can exacerbate inequalities if adaptation strategies are not inclusive and just.

Addressing this challenge requires integrating resilience and equity into climate action at every scale. Policies must recognize historical inequities, strengthen community capacities, and empower local decision-making, ensuring growth does not compromise safety or well-being.

We talk a lot about targets and transitions, but many communities, especially in the Global South, are still dealing with much more immediate issues: unreliable waste systems, rising heat, poor air quality, and the cost of basic energy. When people are navigating survival, climate solutions that feel distant or expensive don�t land.

Another challenge is the way policies are created. The science is clear, but political and economic interests often move faster than evidence. Countries negotiate based on competitiveness, not impact. This slows down agreements like the global plastics treaty and weakens the tools we need to actually reduce pollution and emissions. Meanwhile, industries with power shape the narrative, and local communities, the ones living with the consequences, struggle to be heard.

There�s also the problem of fragmentation. Climate action gets split into separate categories: waste, energy, health, agriculture, and gender. But on the ground, all these issues overlap. You can�t talk about plastic pollution without talking about informal workers. You can�t push clean energy without considering affordability. We need solutions that reflect how people really live.

Without addressing these structural barriers, even well-designed climate policies fail to create real impact.
Another challenge is trust. Many citizens feel disconnected from international climate agendas because decisions are made far from their everyday realities. 
Coordination is also a major issue: cities, national governments and international organisations often operate in silos, despite climate change requiring multilevel governance and long-term accountability.
A key part of the challenge is understanding different realities, not all policies can be applied uniformly across contexts. That is why participation, representation and global cooperation matter so much, especially for regions like the Southern Cone.

In Ghana and many other developing countries, this challenge is worsened by limited climate education, inadequate funding, and weak systems for community engagement. Young people often want to act but lack the knowledge, tools, or platforms to do so. At the same time, vulnerable communities, especially farmers, students, and low-income households, face climate impacts daily but have minimal access to practical guidance or resources to adapt.

Another major challenge is climate misinformation and fatigue. The constant flow of global climate news can overwhelm people, causing them to feel helpless or disconnected from local solutions.

From my work at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Ghana and through the BAL Climate Action Network, I have seen that when people truly understand the connection between climate change and everyday life food security, waste management, clean air, fire safety, they become more willing to engage.

Countries in the global south, have competing priorities and this, in turn, constrains climate action efforts. Examples of these competing priorities include: ensuring energy security (South African, in particular, for years has been plagued by national power blackouts called �loadshedding�); economic growth concerns; addressing poverty; and addressing economic growth in carbon-intensive sectors. Without governance systems capable of managing these issues, climate policies are unlikely to take hold effectively.  Compounding to these issues is the imbalance of power in global climate decision-making. The World Meteorological Organization stated that Africa is disproportionately affected by climate change.

Climate change presents a spectrum of interlinked challenges, from financing gaps and loss & damage to weak adaptation systems and political instability. Yet across all of these, one underlying issue limits the effectiveness of climate action: the absence of a strong rights-based lens. Without grounding climate policy in human rights, many of the other challenges become harder to solve, and climate responses often fail to protect the people most affected. In my work in climate-affected regions of Pakistan, I see how climate impacts immediately become rights issues: women lose access to SRHR during disasters, GBV risks rise in displacement, gender-diverse people face exclusion from aid, and entire communities struggle to access safe water, food, health, and mobility. These are not only impacts; they are violations of basic rights. Yet because climate action is still approached through technical, economic, or infrastructure-heavy frameworks, these rights-based vulnerabilities remain invisible in planning and budgeting.This gap also appears in global climate governance and finance.

My research shows that climate action often breaks down where global ambition meets national reality. Countries like Kenya face limited financing, fragmented governance, and competing development pressures, making it difficult to implement climate commitments at scale. Even when funds exist, they are slow to access, highly bureaucratic, and overly focused on mitigation rather than urgently needed adaptation.

A deeper challenge is climate justice. Communities most affected, pastoralists facing displacement, farmers losing crops, and women whose livelihoods are directly threatened, have the least influence in global decision-making. Without addressing these structural inequalities, climate action risks becoming technically ambitious but socially blind.

There is also growing tension between technological solutions and ethical considerations. Whether in food systems, adaptation technologies, or carbon markets, we often advance tools faster than we consider their social and cultural implications.

Additionally, climate action struggles with coordination. Governments, organizations, and communities sometimes work separately instead of collaborating. This slows progress and prevents the creation of long-term, integrated solutions.

Finally, climate change is moving faster than our current response. Extreme weather, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity are increasing, while adaptation and mitigation efforts remain too slow.

To defeat these challenges, we need stronger partnerships, more inclusive funding, and deeper engagement with local communities. Empowering farmers, young people, and grassroots organizations is essential.",0.57076263,0.21992683,0.6293787,0.8103483918476848,#f3a134
2093,"For me, the biggest challenge for climate action is achieving high-ambition collective action through a bottom-up approach. In Madagascar, environmental and climate change education is still extremely limited. Only universities offer dedicated courses, even though a national decree n� 2013-880 the PeREDD, the environmental and sustainable development education program requires nationwide climate education. It states that all media outlets must provide environmental awareness, and Article 5 mandates the integration of climate change, waste management, and other environmental topics into school curricula from primary level to university. However, this program has not yet been implemented. As a result, many people lack the knowledge needed to understand climate issues and to take individual actions that contribute to climate mitigation. Another major challenge in Madagascar is the lack of motivation among industries to apply the polluter-pays principle. During our research, through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with several companies, we found that most do not pay carbon taxes or environmental taxes. The private sector often resists environmental regulations through industrial unions, and only a few responsible companies voluntarily engage in environmental actions usually without measurable targets. Although Madagascar has increased its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) ambitions for CO? mitigation, implementation remains weak.",0.47350717,0.27313,0.51218355,0.6937335923578581,#f7e379
2094,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and systemic change. While people increasingly understand the urgency of climate issues, individual actions alone are insufficient without large scale policy shifts, corporate accountability, and equitable resource distribution. Many communities, especially in developing regions, face barriers such as lack of funding, limited access to clean technologies, and insufficient education on sustainable practices. Another major challenge is the resistance to change from entrenched economic and political systems that prioritize short term growth over long-term environmental sustainability. This often leads to slow implementation of renewable energy, waste reduction, and conservation initiatives, even when solutions are known and viable. Additionally, climate action is complicated by social inequities: vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by climate impacts yet often have the least capacity to respond. Addressing climate change therefore requires integrated solutions that combine innovation, policy, community engagement, and education.
Overcoming these challenges means bridging the gap between knowledge and action, fostering collaboration across sectors, and ensuring climate solutions are inclusive and accessible.

2095,"I write this application a day after attending a climate impact workshop in Southeast Asia. After three gruelling days of panel conversations, breakout sessions, and plenary discussions, I am left with this question: what now? There is a tendency for scientists and practitioners to be stuck with ideas ; after allocating resources in workshops and conferences (ex., COP), the implementation of these initiatives and action plans remains wanting. 

We already know what to do: pursue Just Transition, engage in co-producing knowledge, and ensure adequate funding. Time and time again, the same calls to action are shared by everyone, but just the same, these are always left as lofty ideals that are not acted upon. This, for me, is the biggest challenge for climate action. Accountability cannot be detached from this conversation. Institutions - both private and public, international and local - can easily claim to pursue these ideals and principles, but communities can only pursue mitigation and adaptation if these institutions actually begin to implement their commitments.

I must admit, however, that responding to the challenge of inaction and accountability is difficult as this requires reimagining norms. For instance, as I prepare to implement the CBIT PH project, I am also confronted with the question of embedding these principles in this seemingly technical and top-down project. As a young climate researcher and practitioner, I want to lead in pursuing genuine implementation.

Another major challenge is the unequal distribution of responsibility and resources. Countries that contribute least to emissions often face the greatest climate risks, while global funding and support remain insufficient. Integrating climate action into broader development priorities is also complex, as policymakers balance urgent social and economic needs with long-term climate strategies.

While policies, finance pledges, and technological roadmaps continue to grow, they often fail to reach the people facing the harshest impacts of droughts, floods, food insecurity, and soil degradation.

This gap is driven by three interconnected issues:
(1) Inequitable climate financing: Adaptation remains underfunded and difficult for developing countries to access. Communities in Malawi who urgently need resources wait years for support intended to protect them.

(2) Over-centralised solutions: Many climate strategies are designed far from affected regions, overlooking local innovations, indigenous knowledge, and low-cost community-led models that are already working across Malawi�s rural communities.

(3) Weak integration between research and policy: Evidence from agricultural research and grassroots adaptation�such as the work we do at Chitedze Agricultural Research Station�rarely informs high-level climate decisions, reducing the effectiveness of interventions.
From my experience in both soil research and community climate projects, I see how this disconnect slows progress.

As a result, vulnerable regions�such as Kenya�s arid and semi-arid lands�lack the resources needed for adaptation, resilience building, and early warning systems, even though they are the most affected by climate impacts.

Additionally, policy decisions are still shaped mainly without meaningful inclusion of frontline communities. Young people, women, Indigenous groups, and rural populations have valuable knowledge, yet they are underrepresented in global climate dialogues. This limits the creation of solutions that are socially just and rooted in local realities.

Even though the intention to reduce emissions has been announced by virtually all states, the pace of the action is significantly lower than the pace of the climatic disruption. A set of mutually dependent barriers maintains this so-called implementation gap. One, political determination is not consistent. The climate legislation is often watered down by short-term electoral politics, changes in the administrative focus, and fossil-fuel-dependent industry lobbying. Thus, long-term climate plans get postponed, have their budgets cut, or even get overturned. Second, climate finance is inadequate and is not distributed equally. The developing countries that are the most vulnerable to climatic hazards get only a small portion of the resources that are needed towards adaptation, early-warning systems, resilience efforts, and low-carbon development.

Politicians are forced to think in terms of quarterly budgets and four-year election mandates, but the climate crisis operates on decades-long timescales. This creates a paralyzing friction: enacting bold, necessary policies�like phasing out fossil fuels or imposing carbon taxes�involves immediate, visible costs to voters (higher energy bills, job transitions). The overwhelming benefits, however, are diffuse and felt years down the line.
This political timidity is what allows environmental injustice to flourish. My own experience with illegal mining showed me that economic greed, driven by a desire for quick returns, constantly undercuts long-term water security and public health.

At the political level, climate policy often competes with short-term interests, election cycles, and polarized public discourse. As a result, governments struggle to commit to long-term strategies that outlast leadership changes. Economically, industries dependent on fossil fuels face high transition costs, while emerging green technologies are still unevenly accessible across countries. Many communities want to act but lack funding, technical expertise, or infrastructure.

It is the same as if they were dumping trash in our backyards (without our consent), except the amount is smaller, irreversible, and the mass is gaseous instead of solid. Moreover, while there are more sustainable and better alternatives, people still use plastic items on a daily basis.

Farming communities especially in climate-vulnerable regions need real-time data, predictive tools, and resilient agricultural systems.

AI, remote sensing, and precision agriculture tools can transform how farmers respond to heat stress, floods, water scarcity, and shifting crop patterns. But without supportive policies, inclusive digital infrastructure, and cross-border data standards, these innovations remain scattered and inaccessible. This disconnect leaves small farmers like those in my indigenous community in rural Pakistan outside the benefits of modern adaptive farming.

The challenge is not the absence of technology; it is the absence of governance that accelerates equitable adoption. Many countries lack clear frameworks for digital agriculture, ethical data use, or AI integration in climate planning.

Another major challenge is the absence of strong waste management systems, which leads to pollution, health risks, and lost opportunities for recycling and circular economy solutions. In places like Kibera, waste is not just an environmental issue but a social and economic one. Without inclusive systems that empower communities, climate action cannot be sustained.

There is also a global challenge of behavior change. Even when people understand the importance of environmental protection, shifting long-standing habits requires consistent education, trust-building, and practical alternatives.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. Many people, organizations, and governments understand the threats of climate change, yet meaningful action is still slow because of limited resources, weak policies, and competing economic priorities. This creates a situation where solutions exist, but they are not applied widely or quickly enough to match the urgency of the climate crisis.

Another major challenge is the lack of climate finance in developing countries. Communities that are most vulnerable�especially in Africa�often do not have the technology, funding, or infrastructure needed to adapt to climate impacts such as droughts, floods, and rising temperatures. Without proper support, climate action becomes uneven and leaves behind those who need help the most.

Additionally, misinformation and low public awareness slow down progress. Many people do not fully understand how climate change affects their lives, which makes it harder to mobilize communities or change behaviors around waste management, energy use, and environmental protection.

Finally, political instability and short-term decision-making remain barriers. Climate change requires long-term commitment, but many leaders prioritize short-term economic gains instead of sustainable development.

In my work across Ecuador, I�ve seen how much knowledge and resilience exists within communities, but also how limited their access can be to resources, information, and spaces where their voices are heard. At the same time, institutions and organizations sometimes work in silos, making it harder to coordinate efforts or build trust.

Through my MERL experience with Internews� Conservando Juntos, I also saw how misinformation and the lack of strong environmental communication can weaken engagement and slow progress.

For me, the biggest challenge is bridging these gaps, between local realities and policy, between information and action, and between communities and institutions.

Many institutions, governments, and communities, particularly in developing regions like Africa, struggle to measure emissions accurately, monitor mitigation efforts, and align actions with national and global climate commitments. Without trustworthy data, policies may be ineffective, investments misdirected, and accountability limited.
This challenge is worsened by fragmented systems, limited technical capacity, and insufficient collaboration. Many organizations lack the tools, expertise, or incentives to collect and analyze environmental data consistently, meaning that efforts to reduce emissions or adapt to climate impacts often remain small-scale or unsustainable.
Addressing this requires robust MRV systems, capacity building, and cross-sector collaboration. Tools that allow transparent emissions tracking, combined with practical implementation guidance, can help stakeholders make informed decisions and remain accountable.
Through Creating Global Solutions (CGS), I work to bridge this gap by conducting baseline emissions audits, designing MRV systems, and helping institutions implement data-driven sustainability strategies.

Climate change also impacts vulnerable groups disproportionately.

This creates a cycle where those most affected are least equipped to act or participate in solutions.

Limited youth engagement in policymaking is another challenge. Young people bring creativity, energy, and local knowledge, but often lack platforms to influence decisions that shape their future.

In emerging economies like India, this is compounded by infrastructure constraints, limited financing, and low stakeholder awareness. Even with ambitious solar and green hydrogen targets, adoption slows due to gaps in policy execution, monitoring, and incentives. Urban transport and mobility projects often fail to reduce emissions because planning, technology, and enforcement remain unaligned.

Addressing this requires systems-level solutions combining data analytics, policy design, and operational execution. My experience demonstrates this: optimizing logistics to reduce carbon intensity, scenario modelling to inform decarbonization policy, and streamlining cross-functional operations to accelerate project delivery.

Governments and industries facing economic or political pressure often prioritise short-term gains over long-term sustainability. Meanwhile, the communities most affected by climate impacts mostly farmers, youth, and vulnerable groups in the Global South are the least represented in global policy decision making.

Another barrier is communication. When climate action is communicated as a threat rather than an opportunity, societal resistance increases.

Another major barrier is the deep inequality in climate finance access. Even the adaptation and resilience funding is strongly correlated with institutional capacity and political influence, not with actual climate vulnerability. Resultantly, the countries and communities most exposed to climate risks receive the least support, while well-resourced actors continue to dominate funding flows and decision-making. This reinforces a cycle where climate-vulnerable nations struggle to prepare, respond, or rebuild.

Another critical barrier is youth engagement and empowerment. Young people are disproportionately affected by climate change yet often lack platforms, resources, and decision-making power to drive change.

We already have many technologies and practices that can reduce emissions and improve resilience, but applying them consistently across sectors and regions remains difficult.

Another challenge is coordination. Climate action involves energy systems, transport, buildings, land use, industry, and finance, all of which operate with different timelines, capacities, and constraints. Without strong alignment, even well-designed initiatives can struggle to reach their full potential.

There is also the challenge of ensuring that solutions are practical, affordable, and adaptable to local conditions. Communities vary in resources, infrastructure, and priorities, which means approaches must be flexible and evidence-based to succeed.

In regions like Western Antalya, where I work as the International Relations Coordinator at the Kumluca Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KUTSO), agriculture and tourism are both vulnerable to climate change and dependent on traditional practices. The challenge lies in making climate adaptation economically viable, socially inclusive, and locally owned. Farmers, small business owners, and young people need accessible tools, financial incentives, and capacity-building to act sustainably�not just to comply with policies, but to see value in transformation.

2123,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the disconnect between climate finance availability and project bankability in developing economies.

Trillions in climate capital exist globally, yet Nigeria alone faces a $27.2 billion annual climate finance gap. The problem isn�t capital scarcity, it�s that international climate finance frameworks are designed for risk profiles, regulatory environments, and project structures that don�t match African realities.

I see this daily structuring infrastructure deals. A renewable energy project that�s technically sound, commercially viable, and genuinely climate-positive still struggles to secure financing because of some policies that are not investment friendly. Meanwhile, Paris alignment requirements, designed with good intentions, can inadvertently block funding for projects that would dramatically reduce emissions compared to current alternatives.

This creates a vicious cycle: developing economies need infrastructure to build climate resilience and transition to clean energy, but can�t access climate finance without infrastructure already in place.

The solution requires redesigning climate finance mechanisms to match ground realities in developing economies, simpler structures, localized risk assessment, and recognition that climate action in Africa looks different than in Europe. We need frameworks that facilitate capital flows to viable projects, not gatekeep them.

We have the science, technologies, and strategies to cut emissions and build resilience, yet implementation remains slow. This is largely driven by unequal access to finance, limited capacity in developing regions, and political hesitation to make bold, long-term decisions. The countries and communities most vulnerable to climate impacts are often the least equipped to adopt clean technologies or influence global climate policy.
For Africa, the challenge is even more complex. Climate action competes with urgent development needs such as energy access, jobs, and infrastructure. Without climate finance that is fair, accessible, and aligned with local priorities, mitigation and adaptation remain difficult to scale.
Another barrier is low climate literacy. When citizens, especially young people, do not fully understand climate risks or the benefits of sustainable choices, it becomes harder to build momentum, demand accountability, or shift behaviors.

Decisions are often made in spaces that are distant from vulnerable communities. This creates a mismatch between ambitious targets and the real capacities of countries and people who must implement them. Finance reflects this divide most clearly. Funding for adaptation and resilience remains far behind what is needed. Many communities in the Global South face floods, fires, droughts, and energy poverty, often without fair access to climate finance or technology. They carry the burden of emissions they did not create while struggling to secure even basic resources for protection and recovery. This gap also appears in knowledge and trust. Scientific progress is fast, yet public understanding and acceptance can lag behind. Without inclusive communication and participation, climate action risks leaving people behind and reinforcing inequality. To overcome this challenge, climate solutions must be co-created with the communities they aim to support. Youth participation, local leadership, and equitable financing are essential.

While international frameworks exist to guide decarbonization and adaptation, their effectiveness is crippled by two systemic bottlenecks. First is the pervasive failure in climate finance and technology transfer. The consistent shortfall in fulfilling the $100 billion annual commitment for developing nations undermines trust and leaves the regions most vulnerable to climate impacts without the essential capital for building resilience and transitioning energy systems.
Second, the challenge is one of governance and social justice. Climate policies often fail to account for local socio-economic realities, leading to resistance and ineffective uptake. Real change requires designing ""just transition"" strategies that integrate climate action as a driver of sustainable, equitable development, ensuring that marginalized populations are not disproportionately burdened. Overcoming this gap�moving from high-level pledges to bottom-up, finance-backed policies that prioritize equity�is the critical bottleneck preventing the world from achieving its necessary climate targets.

Another challenge is the fragmentation of efforts. Governments, NGOs, youth groups, and private actors often work separately instead of building integrated, systemic solutions. At the same time, youth, women, local researchers, and indigenous knowledge holders remain underrepresented in decision-making, despite being closest to the impacts.

Clean technologies also remain too costly or too complex for rural contexts, limiting adoption and creating unequal resilience.

As a result, strong community ideas rarely receive the funding they need.

This perspective deepened in November when I participated in a green finance working group at the ASEAN Centre for Sustainable Development Studies and Dialogue.

Another concern is the replication of similar studies by different institutions, which leads to duplication of effort, inefficient use of resources, and limited impact on the ground. Instead of building on existing knowledge and creating coordinated responses, parallel research activities frequently repeat what is already known, delaying the development of meaningful climate solutions.
This gap between research and practice results in communities such as those around Lake Victoria, who face worsening climate pressures and continue to struggle despite decades of scientific work.

A community cannot adapt to rising temperatures if it simultaneously lacks access to credit, functional governance, and basic infrastructure.

Furthermore, while global frameworks and funds exist, they often fail to reach the local level effectively or are misaligned with community-identified needs.

The problem for nations like Malawi is not a lack of awareness or readiness to take action, but rather the difficulties of converting high-level policy into workable solutions that reach vulnerable people, the slow pace of implementation, and the restricted access to climate money. Local voices, young perspectives, and community knowledge are not completely incorporated into decision-making in many climate programs, which continue to take a top-down approach.  This results in solutions that seem good on paper but don't deal with actual problems like food insecurity and energy poverty.  Inequitable access to sustainable energy technologies is another significant issue.  The most powerful instruments for combating climate change is renewable energy, but because clean technologies are currently too costly or unavailable, many communities continue to rely on costly or unreliable alternatives.

Another major challenge is balancing human needs with environmental protection. As populations grow and livelihoods depend on farming, grazing, and natural resources, it becomes harder to manage land in a sustainable way. Many communities want to support conservation, but poverty, food insecurity, and lack of climate education often push environmental priorities aside.

Finally, climate change is a global issue that requires cooperation, yet countries respond at different speeds. Some contribute more to the problem, while others like Namibia face the harshest impacts despite contributing very little. This inequality slows down global progress.

Overall, the biggest challenge is creating strong, inclusive action that connects policy, community knowledge, and environmental science. To move forward, climate solutions must be accessible, affordable, and supported by both governments and local communities.

The outputs from recent COP iterations only evidence the difficulties associated with making progress on such coordination. The lack of stringent commitments contributes to an outsourcing of emission intensive activities. As is evident in several global supply chains, industries are incentivized to move their carbon emissions to countries with less stringent climate regulations. 

Equally importantly, coordinated action is also necessary among governmental and non-governmental actors. Its current state of inadequacy has resulted in lack of cohesion among adopted strategies. This negatively affects preparedness and resilience in relation to climate change. While governments focus on ratification of instruments, they fall short in implementation efforts by inadequately engaging non-governmental stakeholders.

Climate action depends on people who are willing to give their time and energy to activities like cleanups, sensitization campaigns, and community education. However, only a few individuals are willing to volunteer actively. Many people don�t realize that being an active volunteer also comes with benefits, such as gaining leadership skills, expanding one�s network, enjoying recognition in the community, and being considered for opportunities like trainings, scholarships, and international programs.  Additionally, lack of financial support remains a significant obstacle. Providing small funds�such as snacks, water, or transport stipends�helps boost morale and encourages more people to participate consistently. By addressing awareness, volunteer motivation, funding, and highlighting the benefits of active engagement, we can strengthen climate action efforts and build a more committed and empowered community.",0.4408586,0.13876945,0.35430503,0.6928542286395598,#f7e379

Even though we have invented many sustainable and eco-friendly ways to do most things, many people don�t use them because they want to make more profit and don�t think about nature. Our demands are endless, and in the race for more, the Earth often gets ignored. I have seen this in my own city�trees cut down for construction, streets full of plastic waste, and people rarely thinking about long-term environmental consequences. This short-term thinking makes it hard to adopt solutions even when they are available, and it leads to overconsumption, pollution, and environmental damage. I believe real change will only happen when people start caring about the planet as much as they care about profit and convenience. Programs that raise awareness, encourage sustainable habits, and show how small actions make a difference can help, but the biggest shift must come from a change in mindset.

The first, and I believe the most significant, is the lack of political will; the individuals behind the formulation of policies have not demonstrated convincing commitment to the policy of climate action. This lack of political will has been reflected in the budget appropriation and legal sanctions premised on climate action in Nigeria. The second challenge is that the policies are more reactive rather than proactive, which has posed a challenge in Nigeria in mitigating the consequences of climate change. There are little or no awareness campaigns or sensitisation to the public on the early warning system to the effects of climate change in Nigeria, and this has led to deaths, loss of properties, and forced displacements.

As a result, many policies fail to reach those most affected, and some even reproduce the very injustices they seek to address. Equally critical is the absence of coordinated global responses. Although climate change is a transnational problem, mitigation and adaptation efforts remain highly fragmented. Countries in the Global South face disproportionate impacts despite contributing least to global emissions, while lacking the financial and institutional resources needed for robust action.

This gap is most pronounced in the Global South, which is bearing the brunt of the consequences of global warming despite its historically low contribution to global emissions. The central challenge, therefore, lies in the ability to accelerate implementation while ensuring that climate responses are inclusive, adequately funded, and adaptation-oriented.

Another major issue is the marginalization of young people in climate governance. Although recognized as key players in sustainable transformation, their participation remains too symbolic and insufficiently integrated into public policy development.

Oil, coal, and gas are not just energy sources; they are essential feedstocks for the fertilizers that feed the world, the plastics used in healthcare, and the steel and cement required to house a growing population. Unraveling this dependency is excruciatingly difficult because the global economy rests on trillions of dollars of infrastructure pipelines, refineries, and power plants, designed specifically for these fuels. Furthermore, the chemical advantages of fossil fuels, particularly their immense energy density and ease of transport, make them exceptionally difficult to replace in critical sectors like heavy shipping, aviation, and industrial heating. While we have made strides in greening the electrical grid, we lack scalable, commercially viable substitutes for these ""hard-to-abate"" sectors.

2221,"

I think the biggest challenge for climate action today isn�t just emissions, policies, or technologies, it�s the gap between awareness and meaningful engagement. People know climate change exists; they see floods, heatwaves, dying forests, but for many, it still feels distant, abstract, or too overwhelming to act on. That distance makes it easy to postpone change, to rely on others, or to feel powerless.

Bridging that gap is what real climate action demands. It�s about translating complex science and policy into experiences, stories, and local solutions that resonate with communities. It�s about making people feel their actions matter, that their voices count in shaping the transition. And it�s about ensuring the transition is just, so no one is left behind, and those who have contributed least to the crisis don�t bear the greatest burden.

From my perspective, creative approaches, like spoken word, art, and storytelling, play a crucial role here. They can make climate real, urgent, and human. They can spark conversations where data alone might fail, shift mindsets, and motivate action among young people. Until we close the gap between knowledge and engagement, and connect climate solutions to lived experiences, the challenge of climate action will remain not only technical but deeply social and cultural.",0.26906276,0.27554083,0.45954978,0.7031090770869345,#f3a134
2222,"Major challenge in climate action is the lack of coordinated, inclusive approaches. Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that affects livelihoods, health, food security, and governance, yet responses are often fragmented across sectors or confined to short-term project cycles. Without collaboration between governments, private sector , civil society and local communities the  climate change awareness efforts risk being ineffective or unsustainable.

Another challenge is growing gap between global commitments and actual implementation. While governments, organizations, and communities increasingly recognize the urgency of the climate crisis, concrete actions often lag behind due to limited resources, competing priorities, limited public awareness and structural barriers. This implementation gap is fueled by inadequate financing for adaptation and mitigation  in vulnerable regions that contribute the least to global emissions but face the most severe impacts.

2223,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the way capitalism and large corporations shape our economic system. Most companies still focus on short-term profit, even when their activities harm the environment. This creates a cycle where overconsumption, pollution, and resource extraction continue because they are financially rewarded. As a result, climate policies often move too slowly, and real progress is blocked by powerful corporate interests.

Through my studies in marine sustainability and my journalism work, I have seen how deeply this problem affects communities. For example, small farmers and coastal villages try to adopt sustainable practices, but they struggle to compete with large industries that pollute more and spend more on marketing than on environmental responsibility. This makes people feel powerless, even when they want to protect their environment.

Consumer culture is another challenge. People are encouraged to buy more, and sustainable choices are often too expensive or hard to access. Even individuals who care about climate action feel limited by the system around them.

This issue matters to me because I have witnessed how ecosystems and communities suffer while corporate profits rise.

Despite clear data on climate risks, vulnerable countries face structural barriers that is limited financing, weak climate-health infrastructure, and inadequate technology transfer. Communities most exposed to climate-driven disasters (heatwaves, vector-borne disease outbreaks, food insecurity) often lack representation in global decision-making, resulting in policies that do not reflect local realities.

Another critical challenge is the fragmentation of global cooperation. Climate change is transboundary, yet solutions are often nationalistic. The Global South struggles with disproportionate burdens despite contributing the least to emissions. Without fair access to climate finance, research capacity, and green technologies, adaptation remains insufficient. Finally, misinformation and poor communication slow public engagement.

While international agreements set ambitious targets, practical barriers such as limited funding, technology, and capacity often prevent these commitments from translating into real impact at the local level. In Mongolia, reliance on fossil fuels, aging infrastructure, and lack of awareness make the transition to sustainable energy even more difficult.

Engaging youth and local communities is also a critical challenge. Climate action cannot succeed without citizens� support and active participation, yet opportunities for young people to contribute to policy, implement projects, or access training and resources are often limited.

Additionally, ensuring equitable access to clean energy solutions remains difficult. Vulnerable and marginalized communities face the highest climate risks but have the least capacity to adopt sustainable solutions.

Overcoming these challenges requires stronger international collaboration, knowledge sharing, and targeted support for developing countries. Initiatives like Ideas Lab are essential, as they connect young leaders, experts, and communities, enabling the exchange of innovative ideas, practical solutions, and best practices. These platforms help turn global climate ambitions into tangible, local impact and foster inclusive, lasting climate action.

While global climate targets grow more urgent, many solutions remain technologically complex, capital intensive, and designed for global North contexts. This leaves most of the Global South where climate impacts hit hardest yet unable to participate at the speed or scale required.

For example, agriculture generates significant emissions and faces severe soil degradation, yet smallholder farmers rarely have access to technologies or financing that would allow them to transition to regenerative and low-carbon practices. Climate finance often flows to large corporations or high-profit sectors, not to communities that can deliver real, distributed impact.

Another major challenge is trust and measurability. Carbon markets face credibility issues, yet they are one of the few tools capable of channelling private capital into climate action at scale. Without transparent, affordable MRV and strong governance, high-quality carbon removal projects struggle to grow.

Finally, climate narratives are still dominated by high-income countries. This limits the diversity of approaches, undervalues indigenous knowledge, and slows innovation suited for tropical, agricultural, and low-resource settings.

Another major obstacle is the slow adoption of clean technologies. Renewable energy systems, energy-efficient grids, and climate-resilient infrastructure often require upfront investment, technical expertise, and maintenance capabilities that many vulnerable regions lack. As a result, solutions exist but are inaccessible to the people who need them most.

Finally, climate action is hindered by a disconnect between knowledge and behavior. Communities may be aware of climate risks, yet poverty, lack of alternatives, and systemic barriers prevent meaningful action.

While international frameworks focus on large scale targets, many communities face daily structural issues such as limited access to climate aligned technology, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient financing, and policies that do not reflect local social and economic contexts. This gap results in solutions that are not inclusive, scalable, or culturally relevant.

From the perspective of my own work in sustainable fashion innovation, the challenge is also behavioural and systemic. The fashion industry continues to overproduce because its economic model is built on volume, not accuracy. Poor sizing, excessive returns, and textile dumping persist because waste has been normalised as a ""cost of doing business."" 

Ultimately, we need solutions that recognise different communities� needs, consumption habits, and lived experiences. The challenge is creating climate action that is both globally coordinated and locally grounded, ensuring that innovation does not leave emerging markets behind.",0.37967277,0.27083284,0.52229834,0.7311504276933396,#f3a134
2252,"As a result of severe climate change impacts agriculture which is the backbone of the country�s economy has seen a significant decline.  Farming throughout the globe has its own specifics that depends on weather conditions, with the climate change impact on agriculture being tremendous. Climate patterns nowadays are not the same as they were before. In their analysis on how climate change affects agriculture, agriculturalists have to adopt methods they have never previously tried. These impacts of global climate change on agriculture forces farmers to keep adjust to abnormal or atypical weather like lack of snow cover in winter, which means high risks of poor yields of winter cash crops. The effects also involve abnormally hot summers and very cold winters, or vice versa, warm winters and chilly summers which we are experiencing currently in Lesotho. Lack of rainfalls which is another impact of climate change on agriculture brings the necessity of manmade irrigation in the regions where it was done solely by nature before. Plants are sensitive to floods as much as to droughts and perish both ways.",0.64455724,0.47813022,0.2886529,0.33923482536927335,#45ce1c
2253,"The single biggest challenge for climate action today is not a technological or scientific gap, but a profound implementation gap the failure to translate global ambitions and isolated innovations into coordinated, locally-relevant, and scalable action on the ground. We possess the necessary knowledge and a growing suite of solutions, from renewable energy to carbon capture. However, these technologies often remain siloed or are deployed without deep integration into socio-economic contexts. This creates a disconnect where top-down policies miss local realities, and ground-level initiatives lack the resources and networks to scale.
The core of this challenge is fragmented collaboration. Scientists, engineers, policymakers, businesses, and communities often operate in parallel, speaking different languages and pursuing different metrics of success. A brilliant scientific model fails without a viable business case; a well-intentioned policy backfires without community trust and behavioral insight.
My experience developing the Algal Carbon Capture Framework cemented this view. The science is promising, but its real-world success hinges on merging engineering scalability with economic models that work for investors and social acceptance from the communities that host these projects. Bridging these disconnected domains, fostering a shared language and a unified systems-view, is the critical, and most neglected, work of our time.

2254,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the widening gap between high level global commitments and real implementation at the local level, especially in vulnerable communities across the Global South. While international agreements promise ambition, many countries lack the financial resources, political support and institutional capacity needed to turn these commitments into meaningful, community-driven action.

Furthermore, there is an education gap. We cannot expect people to protect an environment they do not understand. Policy language is often too technical for the average citizen. To fix this, we need to translate global climate goals into local actions (like climate-smart agriculture) that people can see and touch. The challenge is ensuring that resources and education flow directly to the ""frontlines"" where young people are ready to work

Also, Young people who make up the majority of populations in countries like Sierra Leone, remain underrepresented in formal climate decision-making processes. Despite being powerful drivers of change, youth often lack access to funding, technical training and policy platforms that would allow them to meaningfully contribute to national and global climate strategies.

To overcome these challenges, we need stronger youth inclusion, greater investment in grassroots leadership, more equitable climate financing, and policies that translate global ambitions into local action.

Another major challenge is the inequality between countries to put climate actions in plactice. Countries that contribute least to climate change are often the ones experiencing its most severe impacts,yet they have fewer resources to adapt and build resilience. Insufficient climate finance, slow delivery of promised funds, and limited access to technology widen this divide. Without addressing these inequalities, climate action cannot be effective or just.

In addition, lack of public awareness and low youth engagement remain obstacles, especially in communities where environmental education is limited.

Many countries commit to bold targets under the Paris Agreement, but translating those goals into concrete, coordinated action at the national, community, and household levels remains extremely difficult. This is due to limited resources, weak governance structures, and the lack of consistent public/civic engagement in climate decisions. We often do not know the progress or methodology of the implementations. For many, including Mongolia, climate change is in our daily lives, pollution, health risks, extreme weather, winter zuds, rapid urbanisation & crowding. However climate policies may not truly reflect or address these real lived experiences. Youth in particular want to contribute but lack access to knowledge, tools, and decision-making spaces. Globally, the core issue is not a lack of awareness, but a lack of synergy. Climate science, policymaking, funding, and community realities still operate in separate circles, and major conventions such as the Rio Conventions on climate, land, and biodiversity also face lack of synergy.

We already do know the science, the risks and many of what might be done, but countries and institutions are finding it hard to transform plans into a concrete response. Front-line communities, especially in Africa, suffer the effects each day, but the resources, funding, and support they get are limited. It faces another difficulty: inequality. Some regions contribute the least to global emissions but suffer the most from climate impacts. This makes adaptation more difficult, and slows progress in the long term. Young people also encounter barriers when they attempt to participate in decision-making even though they have strong ideas and action momentum. Climate action is too often hindered by lack of coordination. Governments, business and local people generally work alone, diluting efficiency. But the solutions to these issues require collaboration, trust and shared responsibility. To me, addressing these challenges requires building more political will, ramping up climate finance for vulnerable countries and giving more space for youth and local communities to lead solutions.

2259,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between ambition and implementation. 
Although governments industries and global institutions continue to set bold climate targets the practical steps needed to achieve them are underfunded or delayed. This implementation gap is driven by two mostly interconnected challenges.

First, insufficient financing remains a major barrier especially for developing and climate vulnerable countries. Many nations lack access to affordable technology infrastructure investment and resilience building funds. Without strong financial support, even the most promising climate solutions cannot scale.

Second, policy inconsistency slows progress. Shifting political priorities and short-term decision making prevent long-term climate strategies from taking root. Effective climate action requires stable policies that encourage innovation and support clean-energy transitions.

Overall, the greatest challenge is not the lack of solutions but the lack of coordinated,equitable and sustained action. Bridging this gap requires global solidarity stronger investment in clean technologies, and inclusive policies that ensure climate-vulnerable regions such as many communities in Africa are not left behind.

2260,"One main issue surrounding climate action is the tension between historical responsibility and current impacts. Most developing countries and LDC�s strongly believe that Developed countries are historically responsible for majority of emissions, while developing countries are most vulnerable to effects of climate change, despite contributing less. This leads to disagreements over who should bear the costs for mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage, with developing nations demanding financial and technological support from richer countries to transition to a green economy. Developing nations view stringent climate policies imposed by developed nations as unfair, given the disparities in economic and industrial capabilities. They advocate for a climate justice approach, for the developed nations to bear more of the financial burden. The multiplicity of intersecting global economic, social, political, and environmental challenges is hampering the progress towards achievement of Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Managing expectations with regard to climate action between the developed and the developing world, is one of the main irritants in brining countries together to collaborate and create a united front in resolving the issue of climate change.

While global commitments and funding have grown, top-down approaches often overlook local contexts, cultural knowledge, and the voices of marginalized groups, particularly young people in the Global South who experience climate impacts firsthand. This disconnect results in interventions that are poorly adapted, insufficiently supported, or even counterproductive.

Another key challenge is bridging the gap between policy, science, and grassroots action. Many communities have innovative adaptation and mitigation practices, but these are rarely scaled or integrated into national and international climate strategies. Similarly, youth and civil society organizations often lack meaningful access to decision-making spaces, limiting their ability to shape policies that affect their futures.

Addressing this challenge requires participatory governance, capacity building, and mechanisms that elevate community-driven solutions alongside global policy frameworks. My experience in designing youth-led climate accelerators, managing multi-country programs, and translating research insights into actionable recommendations demonstrates that engaging diverse stakeholders can generate more effective, context-sensitive, and sustainable climate action.

2262,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between global commitment and practical implementation. Many countries, institutions, and leaders publicly endorse climate goals, yet translating these promises into real action remains slow due to limited resources, weak policy enforcement, and competing national priorities. This implementation gap delays progress in areas like renewable energy expansion, climate-smart agriculture, and resilient infrastructure.

Another major challenge is financing. Developing countries�especially in Africa�face the harshest effects of climate change but have the least access to climate funds. Insufficient funding for adaptation makes vulnerable communities struggle with rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, and increased disease outbreaks. Without reliable financial support, it becomes difficult to scale community-level solutions or invest in long-term resilience.

Public awareness and behavior change also remain a barrier. Many communities still lack the knowledge or tools to adopt climate-friendly practices, while misinformation slows global cooperation. At the same time, young people with passion and ideas often lack platforms to participate meaningfully.

Finally, climate action is challenged by weak collaboration. Solutions require governments, youth groups, scientists, private sectors, and communities to work together. Yet most efforts remain fragmented and small-scale.

This makes climate action feel distant or overwhelming, especially in vulnerable regions. Another major challenge is the lack of strong cooperation between global policymakers and the communities most affected by climate change. Many decisions are taken far away from the realities of rural farmers, youth groups, or local organisations. As a result, solutions may not match the actual needs on the ground, causing slow progress in adaptation and resilience. Climate misinformation and low awareness also make climate action harder.

Fragmented institutions, short-term policy cycles, and limited regional cooperation prevent effective long-term climate strategies. When environmental stress intersects with economic instability and geopolitical tensions, climate action becomes harder to prioritize even as its consequences grow more severe.

Globally, many countries face similar structural challenges: weakened state capacity, competing political interests, and a lack of integrated planning. This leads to a collective-action problem where no single country feels able, or willing to move first at the scale necessary.

Yet their voices are rarely included in decision-making. Without local participation and community-led approaches, climate solutions remain incomplete or fail to work in reality.

Awareness is also a barrier. Many people still see climate change as a future problem or a technical issue, not something connected to their daily lives. We need stronger narrative change through education, storytelling, and science communication.

In countries like Pakistan, women, low-income families, and remote communities face the highest risks but have the least influence over decisions that affect them. Without meaningful participation, climate action becomes fragmented. It focuses on short-term fixes instead of long-term resilience.

Climate finance and resource allocation add another layer of difficulty. Funding is often slow, difficult to access, or not designed for the needs of communities that require it most.

So the real challenge is our solutions are not designed for the complexity of the crisis. Until climate action fully acknowledges its intersection with peace, security, oceans, gender, and governance supported by integrated financing and genuinely inclusive decision-making, we will continue to respond to symptoms instead of shifting the system.

For example, at the recent COP30 in Bel�m, Brazil, Kick Big Polluters Out�s analysis showed there were at least 1.602 fossil fuel lobbyists, who received two-thirds more passes to the event than all the delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries combined. While people across the world face the devastating reality of fossil fuel-induced climate change, fossil fuel giants are actively ramping up their efforts to spread misleading claims about their environmental impacts and position themselves as climate champions. This stifles public demand for climate action so the Big Oil can keep polluting. It is likely that such efforts were part of the reason why the summit ended without an agreement for fossil fuel phaseout.

For example, In the municipal sector, waste segregation, safe disposal, and recycling are often discussed but not effectively practiced. In many cases, waste is dumped directly at the dumping sites without proper processing or management. As a result, the areas around these dumping sites experience strong bad odour, making it difficult for nearby communities to breathe and creating serious environmental and health concerns.
This gap exists due to limited resources, lack of training, weak monitoring, and low community participation.

Many people know climate change is happening, but the steps needed to reduce the impact are not happening fast enough. In Nigeria and many parts of the world, this problem comes from lack of funding, weak policies, poor education, and limited access to clean energy.

In Nigeria, one major challenge is dependence on fossil fuels like petrol and diesel. Many homes and businesses use generators because electricity supply is not stable. This leads to more carbon emissions and air pollution. Another challenge is that many communities do not have enough knowledge about climate change, so they continue practices like bush burning, improper waste disposal, and deforestation.

Globally, the challenge is similar. Countries talk about climate action, but many still delay strong policies because they fear economic loss.

The transport sector faces similar failures: poorly regulated vehicles and weak inspection systems contribute heavily to carbon emissions. Limited public awareness also means communities rarely recognise environmental damage as a threat to their wellbeing and fundamental rights.

Energy systems further reflect this enforcement gap. Despite global progress, many countries remain dependent on fossil fuels, with outdated grids, widespread generator use, and slow investment in renewables.

When NEER tried accessing government resources, we hit bureaucratic walls, unclear criteria and funding designed for large organizations, not student-led projects. This isn't unique: research shows less than 17% of global climate finance reaches local level, though communities implement most adaptation. For urban poor, only 3.5% reaches them, despite being most vulnerable.

This has real consequences. India's National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture allocates significant funds, yet farmers in drought-stressed regions report limited access to weather advisories or crop insurance. Finance architecture creates catastrophic leakages, intermediary costs and bureaucratic layers drain resources before reaching the ground.

There's also a knowledge translation problem. Climate science exists but is rarely contextually translated. NEER learned this: abstract sustainability messaging failed, but when we connected groundwater depletion to water systems their grandparents used, communities engaged immediately. Climate action requires meeting people where they are culturally and linguistically.

The solution isn't more commitments, it's redesigning finance architecture for direct community access, building implementation capacity, and creating accountability metrics tracking delivery, not pledges. Until we fix this gap, climate finance remains performative.

I believe the biggest climate challenge today is the rapid increase of climate-related disasters that are happening faster than communities can adapt. We are no longer dealing with slow environmental change�people are facing floods, droughts, heatwaves, and storms that destroy homes, crops, and livelihoods in a very short time. This crisis is worsened by limited resources, weak early-warning systems, and the fact that the most vulnerable communities contribute the least to climate change yet suffer the most.

In my country, Malawi, this challenge is very clear. We have experienced cyclones, prolonged dry spells, unpredictable rainfall, hunger, and displacement of families. Many households do not have the resilience or economic capacity to recover after each disaster, which creates a cycle of poverty and vulnerability. Climate change is no longer a distant scientific issue�it is a direct threat to human life, food security, water availability, and economic development.

Because the climate is changing faster than our systems can respond, the urgency now is to strengthen adaptation, invest in early-warning systems, empower communities with education, and ensure young people are part of the solutions.

These challenges slow down the implementation of decarbonization strategies and make it difficult to adopt long-term, science-based policies.
Another major challenge is the growing inequality in climate impacts and responsibilities. Countries in the Global South are often the most vulnerable to climate risks yet have the least resources to respond.

Climate change is a global problem, but different countries have different needs and priorities. Some want to grow their economy, some rely on fossil fuels, and some are already suffering from climate disasters. This makes it hard to agree on what to do and when. 
In addition to the challenge of coordinating efforts, financing posses another obstacle as switching energy systems and building better cities requires large investments but funding is usually slow and uncertain. The complexity of different funding schemes, as well as challenges in tracking and managing how funds are used, adds further difficulty.
Another challenge is the structure of the system itself. Individual efforts, while important, are not enough without major responsibility from governments, large corporations, and technology companies. Policies, regulations, and infrastructure need to support sustainable behavior, and big actors must reduce emissions, invest in clean technologies, and lead systemic change. Without this top-down responsibility, it is difficult to achieve meaningful progress.

In addition, climate action is hindered due to the lack of needed institutions to play this role because of the higher levels of fragility and fragmentation. In such a context of ongoing armed conflict, there is no suitable context for developing data and all other related frameworks for early warning.

2318,"My climate journey began during my undergraduate research project, where I was introduced to the potential of Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae as a climate-smart solution for transforming organic waste into valuable agricultural inputs. This experience sparked my passion for circular agriculture and showed me how simple biological systems can create practical environmental benefits.

Today, I apply this knowledge by collecting organic waste from households, markets, and farms and using it to rear BSF larvae. This process reduces methane emissions from decomposing waste, cuts down pollution, and produces affordable insect protein and organic fertilizer for farmers. I also train farmers and young people on how BSF farming lowers feed costs, improves soil health, and supports climate-friendly agricultural practices.

My work directly addresses major climate challenges in my community, including unmanaged waste, declining soil quality, and dependence on carbon-intensive farming inputs. By turning waste into value, I help farmers adopt more resilient, low-carbon methods that protect both their livelihoods and the environment.

Another challenge is how overwhelming climate change can feel. When daily life is already a struggle with food, income, or school, taking action on climate issues can seem like something for later. Yet the people who contribute least to the problem are often the ones affected the most, facing floods, droughts, and failing crops with little help.

2321,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the continuous gap between ambition, implementation and accountability. While climate commitments have accelerated globally, the systems needed to turn them into measurable, enforceable, and socially accepted actions remain fragmented.

First, policy-implementation gaps continue to delay progress. Even where strong climate frameworks exist, such as in the EU, many initiatives depend on coordinated action across multiple sectors, agencies, and local authorities. This creates inconsistencies in enforcement, data collection, and long-term planning, especially in areas like circular economy, green procurement, and industrial decarbonisation.

Second, incomplete or low-quality data prevents effective monitoring of progress. Corporate climate disclosures often remain incomparable across regions, while supply-chain data for emissions, waste, and environmental impact is still limited. This weakens accountability for both public and private actors. My work on ESG screening and CDP assessments has shown how difficult it is to evaluate companies when data is inconsistent or lacks verification.

Third, social and behavioural barriers slow down the adoption of sustainable practices. My research on household recycling behaviour illustrates how pro-environmental action depends not only on infrastructure or regulation, but also on social norms, trust, and everyday habits.

Many people, governments, and organizations understand that climate change is a serious threat, but the response is still too slow compared to the urgency of the crisis. Even though we already have the knowledge and technology to reduce emissions and protect the planet, action is often delayed.

One reason is that climate solutions usually require long-term investment, while leaders still focus on short-term economic interests. This leads to postponed policies on renewable energy, conservation, and sustainability. Another challenge is inequality: countries that pollute the most are often not moving fast enough to reduce their emissions, while developing countries do not always have enough resources to adopt green technologies. This lack of fairness makes global progress difficult.

Public engagement is also a major barrier. Many people want to help but do not always know how to take action, or they lack access to sustainable alternatives in daily life. As a result, climate action becomes something discussed more than practiced.

This mismatch between uniform solutions and highly uneven realities is a fundamental barrier. Regions differ in their economic conditions, social structures, access to technology,  and even cultural norms. As a result, communities with the least resources to adapt- women, children, low-income households, and �trapped populations� are often left behind, even when climate interventions exist on paper.
Another dimension of this challenge is that climate stress interacts with other vulnerabilities: livelihood insecurity, poor health systems, weak social protection, or limited mobility. These overlapping risks make adaptation far more complex.  People need their freedom, resources, and support to act on climate risks, not just awareness of them.
Finally, climate action is slowed by the gap between global narratives and local lived experience. Policies and frameworks frequently overlook the realities of ground implementation- what people can actually do, what they can afford, and how climate impacts disrupt their daily lives.
For climate action to be effective and just, we must acknowledge this and design responses that are flexible, locally rooted, and centred on the needs of the most vulnerable.

The major challenge which these vulnerable communities face is that most of the funding is directed using top-down approach whereby grassroots communities� initiatives hardly get sponsored. As a result, there must be meaningful conversations with young leaders who are driving change in their respective regions to foster deep understanding of innovative and inclusive financing mechanisms.

Smallholders also deal with high feed prices, disease outbreaks, and weak market access, which makes it difficult for them to invest in climate-smart practices even when they want to.

These issues are made worse by weak extension services, limited affordable credit, poor rural infrastructure, and the lack of climate information in local languages. Women and youth, who make up a large part of small-scale farming, often feel these challenges the most.

I believe real climate action must focus on closing this last-mile gap � delivering simple, practical, and low-cost climate-smart guidance in ways farmers can actually use.

Many people prioritize convenience and lifestyle trends over the health of the planet. As a result, we consume more than we need, produce large amounts of waste, and continue habits that worsen global warming. This mindset makes it difficult to encourage communities to change their behavior or adopt sustainable practices.

Urbanization also plays a major role. As cities expand rapidly, natural areas are destroyed, pollution increases, and access to green spaces becomes limited. Many people living in urban centers feel disconnected from nature, which reduces their sense of responsibility to protect the environment.

Another serious challenge is the influence of social media. While it can be a powerful tool for awareness, it also encourages unhealthy competition and materialistic lifestyles. When young people constantly see luxurious lifestyles, fast fashion, and unnecessary consumption online, they feel pressure to imitate what they see. This drives even more overconsumption and distracts from climate priorities.

2339,"Amidst all of the micro-challenges that restrict the expansion and smooth implementation of the climate action pillars, the existence of a non-supportive leadership remains one of the biggest hurdles for climate action. In fact, the rise of the Trump administration in the US shifted considerably the momentum that several climate action initiatives had gradually built over the years since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, pushing several US companies and banks to publicly announce their withdrawal from global net-zero alliances which has led to a tremendous fall in US funding dedicated to countering climate change. 

Similarly, in Morocco for instance, while young Moroccan professionals and the youth in general are hyper aware about the vulnerability of the country and the African continent against the adverse impacts of climate change, senior leaders withholding the keys to funding and urgent action remain reluctant towards moving at high speed towards fostering climate action. This resistance tends to postpone the urgent and preventative work needed to get implemented within multiple sectors within the country, causing an increased climate risk as a result. Hence, I strongly believe that in our current times, given the interdisciplinary nature of climate action, the existence of climate-aware and climate action oriented leaders is a mandatory aspect and could be a emancipator of nations even within dark climate scenarios and realities.

The challenges in climate action are many, but I am focusing on the agricultural sector because of my direct experience working with smallholder farmers. The biggest challenges for climate action in agriculture today are unpredictable weather. Farmers who rely on rain-fed farming are increasingly affected by droughts, floods, and irregular rainfall, which reduce crop yields and threaten their livelihoods. These extreme events make farming more risky and unpredictable. At the same time, limited access to timely weather information makes it difficult for farmers to adapt effectively and build resilience against climate impacts.
Another challenge is scaling climate solutions. The solutions are  not scaled beyond pilot projects or demonstration plots because there are insufficient programs, incentives, or support mechanisms to encourage broader adoption. Without strategies to expand successful interventions and make them accessible to more farmers, the impact remains limited, and many communities continue to face high vulnerability to climate risks. 
Addressing these challenges requires connecting policies to practical solutions, providing farmers with accessible knowledge and resources, and creating incentives to scale effective practices. Only then can smallholder farmers adapt, protect their livelihoods, and ensure food security in a changing climate.

1. Political will
We already have mature solutions such as renewables, efficiency, storage and electrification. The real blockage is political economy: fossil interests, short election cycles and fear of disruption to jobs and prices. This slows down the phase out of coal, oil and gas even when clean options are cheaper.

2. Climate finance and inequality
For countries like Ghana and many in the Global South, the problem is not only ambition, but access to affordable capital and fair rules. Projects that are clearly climate positive still struggle with high interest rates, currency risk and rigid donor requirements. People remain locked into energy poverty and fossil fuels even though they want clean, reliable energy.

3. Trust and narrative gap
Many communities see climate policy as something done to them, not with them: carbon taxes without safety nets, land use rules without participation, or green investments that do not deliver jobs or justice.

Young people want to support climate action, but without clear pathways for green jobs, training, and social protection, climate action can feel like a threat instead of an opportunity. Another major challenge is that young workers� voices are often missing from national climate discussions, even though we will inherit the long-term consequences.

When people in positions of power dismiss the urgency of the crisis, it not only slows global efforts but can also reverse progress that has been made. Their denial weakens accountability, reduces political will and worsens inequalities between communities and countries. The lack of unified commitment makes it harder to implement effective policies and mobilise the resources needed for mitigation and adaptation. Moreover, it also creates confusion among the public, making it more difficult to build collective action and long term support for climate solutions. To address this challenge, we need more platforms like Ideas Lab that bring together young people, experts, policy makers and community leaders from different parts of the World.

The most dangerous belief is I am too small to matter. That belief has made silence normal and action optional.
And a new threat is rising quietly behind this collective numbness. Artificial Intelligence. It is becoming the fastest growing consumer of energy and water on the planet. Each digital interaction feels invisible with no smoke or waste to trigger guilt. But the servers behind our screens consume unimaginable resources. We love AI because it makes life easier. We do not want to see the environmental destruction hidden behind convenience.
So the true challenge is this contradiction. We are the most informed generation in history and yet the most capable of ignoring what we know. We want solutions without sacrifice. Progress without accountability. Smart technology without asking who pays the ecological price.

In Rwanda, this means that despite global pledges, families still lack the resources and infrastructure to adapt to climate threats like floods, droughts, and climate-related diseases.

This problem is made worse by complicated finance systems and limited feedback from local communities. Decision-makers often miss critical local evidence, like the climate-health data we collect through our initiatives, which is essential for effective adaptation planning.

Powerful actors�such as oil and gas investors, state utilities, and interest groups�strongly influence energy and climate policy at national and global levels. In Global South countries like Thailand and Myanmar, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and national oil companies often resist energy transition, delaying efforts to mitigate climate change or address its social and environmental impacts.
Even when national energy policies set ambitious renewable targets, SOEs protect their economic interests by shaping policy narratives. For example, in Thailand, they argue that natural gas is essential for stable power and claim renewable energy is unreliable or threatens grid stability. These narratives slow decarbonization and undermine climate commitments.
In my view, the biggest challenge is not purely technical. It is multidimensional, rooted in power dynamics, economic interests, and governance structures that shape decision-making.

Vulnerable populations, including displaced people, rural communities, and those living in fragile contexts, face limited access to clean energy, sustainable livelihoods, or climate-resilient infrastructure. This creates a cycle where those most affected have the fewest resources to adapt. At the same time, humanitarian and development actors often work in parallel rather than in coordinated, long-term ways, making it difficult to scale sustainable solutions.

Another major challenge is ensuring that climate action is both inclusive and equitable. Technical solutions exist, but without strong community engagement, cultural understanding, and accessible communication, even well-designed initiatives fail to bring lasting impact.

If we truly considered the people, I think solutions would be more inclusive, and financing would follow that inclusivity. One of my professors said something that really stuck with me: �The just transition isn�t just a transition,� and I keep coming back to that. If countries and policy-makers could carry the spirit of that sentence into negotiation rooms, into budgets, into plans, I think we would see so much more progress. So, to me, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the lack of human-centricity in climate action today. ",0.45842004,0.48587692,0.54465437,0.7376456609682575,#f3a134

These social barriers prevent young women from developing the essential technical and leadership skills needed for regional innovation and adaptation.

From a youth perspective, coming from a climate-vulnerable country, Nepal, which lacks both in resources and power, in this lens I would definitely say finance is a biggest challenges which has been reducing climate action initiatives and in todays scenario where the grants and financial aids has been cut off at maximum making developing nations more vulnerable in climate induced impacts and as a result our climate initiatives has also been reduced. It also leads to limited opportunities for research on practical, sustainable, and innovative initiatives that could have actually driven change. But as a project associate lens working on ground over 4 years, I would say awareness and neglegence can also be a major challenge as many people are still unaware of increasing climate threat, and some people still are building there homes nearby rivers unaware that they can lose it in the near future by floods or other climate induced disasters, and sometime even knowing the issue they are neglecting to work on driving soultions which can result a challenge.�But on a bigger frame, finance is the ultimate challenge on today's scenario.

2371,"The biggest challenge for climate action today lies in the disconnect between global commitments and local-level implementation. While international frameworks and national strategies acknowledge the importance of climate adaptation and mitigation, translating these commitments into practical, funded, and sustained action on the ground remains difficult.
A major barrier is insufficient financing, especially for adaptation. Many vulnerable communities, farmers, displaced people, and low-income households, struggle to access the resources needed to adopt climate-smart technologies, diversify livelihoods, or build resilience to shocks such as droughts, heatwaves, and flooding. Even when funding exists, short project timelines, fragmented interventions, and limited coordination reduce long-term impact.
Another challenge is the lack of localized climate data and technical capacity. Local authorities, NGOs, and community groups often lack the tools to measure climate risks, design adaptation plans, and track outcomes. This leads to reactive rather than proactive climate planning.
Additionally, climate action competes with urgent humanitarian needs, making it difficult for governments and organizations to prioritize long-term resilience over immediate relief.

Overall, without stronger investment, inclusive planning, and a shift from short-term projects to long-term resilience strategies, climate action will continue to fall behind the speed and scale of climate change.",0.7997534,0.48745233,0.8768468,0.820326172757758,#f3a134

A portrait of enduring colonialism, it is no coincidence that Black people, Indigenous people, and other minority communities reside in the most at-risk and peripheral regions, which are also abandoned by the State.

These groups, which constitute the smallest contributors to global emissions and degradation, are consistently the ones facing the highest exposure to heat, pollution, extreme weather, and ecosystem collapse. They are deemed expendable, and not even developed countries have been able to address this problem effectively. Take, for example, the Roma population, who subsist without access to adequate sanitation throughout Europe, living close to landfills and in settlements near toxic sites. What good is it to talk about climate adaptation for future generations if we do not take care of the present of racialized people?

Environmental racism undermines climate action. Communities most affected are rarely included in negotiations, which undermines the effectiveness of policies. It's impossible to talk about climate action without understanding its impact on traditional fishermen, small farmers, and marginalized urban groups.

While global commitments have expanded, many countries, especially least developed and developing countries, face overlapping barriers: limited financing, fragmented institutions and uneven technical capacities. This concern was reaffirmed at COP30, which emphasized the need to move from negotiation to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.
This gap is worsened by deep global inequalities. Those who contribute least to the climate crisis are often the most exposed to its impacts, yet they have the least access to resources for mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage. Without aligning governance, finance and technology to support fair and inclusive transitions, climate action risks reinforcing existing injustices instead of correcting them.
Addressing this challenge requires scaling predictable and accessible climate finance, strengthening institutional coherence, improving participatory decision-making and creating mechanisms that bridge science, policy, community knowledge and innovation.

Ambitious targets and formal commitments are announced in international spaces, but the people already living through climate disruption often remain excluded from the decision-making tables. This disconnect is reinforced by inequities in knowledge valuation: scientific measurements are treated as authoritative, while lived experiences are treated as anecdotal. Communities that deeply understand environmental rhythms are rarely recognized as holders of legitimate climate knowledge.

Climate finance and implementation processes are another barrier. Funds move slowly and with restrictions that exclude smaller grassroots efforts, even when those efforts are closest to impact. Meanwhile, climate narratives remain concentrated in the Global North, shaping the language and framing of climate action in ways that don�t always reflect realities in the Global South.

What we need is a reorientation of climate governance toward inclusion, listening, and humility. Solutions must be shaped with communities rather than prescribed to them.

2376,"The biggest challenges to climate action today is Economic instability, particularly in developing countries. People are often more focused on meeting basic needs than engaging in climate control initiatives. As a result, internal combustion engines remain the preferred choice for transportation and industry, since electric vehicles though cleaner, are costly. The emissions from cars, buses, trucks and heavy machinery, outweigh current efforts to reduce pollution. While technologies such as electronic control systems help optimize fuel use and lower emissions, they are insufficient. Stronger commitments and practical implementation are needed.
Transporters, aware that their vehicles contribute to air pollution, often continue using them because they cannot afford repairs or replacements. Although laws exist, enforcement is weak and public sympathy for violators (seen as struggling providers) creates further barriers.
Public awareness and active participation in climate initiatives remain limited, especially in Nigeria. Targeted programs in schools, religious institutions and community spaces are essential to drive engagement.

Institutional barriers such as fragmented governance, policy conflicts, and limited adaptive capacity further impede effective adaptation and mitigation, especially in vulnerable communities.

Psychological barriers, including limited understanding, ideological resistance, and underestimation of others� willingness to act, also restrict individual and societal engagement in climate solutions.

Although climate science is advancing rapidly, many countries, especially in the Global South struggle to translate this knowledge into effective, inclusive, and scalable climate solutions.

A major consequence is that nature-based solutions remain underutilized, particularly those involving overlooked organisms such as fungi, which are fundamental for carbon cycling, soil regeneration, and ecosystem resilience. Without integrating these key components of nature, climate action risks being incomplete and less effective.
Another critical challenge is the unequal distribution of climate impacts versus climate decision-making power. The communities most affected by climate change often have the least influence on shaping climate policies or accessing adaptation resources.

That makes ambitious climate measures politically toxic, even when they make sense on paper.

On the other side, climate finance from the Global North is slow, complex and often comes as loans instead of grants. Communities are asked to change how they cook, move and produce, but they do not see the promised support arrive at scale or on time. This gap between promises and lived reality feeds cynicism.

Despite the growing awareness of its consequences, meaningful climate action continues to fall behind what science demands. Several political, social and economic barriers interact to render efforts of climate action futile in today�s world.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action is the persistent gap between scientific research and actual policy implementation. The lack of political will has been the major obstacle to global climate action. Many of government institutions are hesitant about implementing strong policies because of short-term economic interest and the fear of losing political votes. Many studies have diagnosed issue of climate change and suggest effective solution, but these recommendations are often unimplemented due to the lack of political will power.

An aspect of this challenge can be attributed to the lack of funding to drive climate action. Recommendations from studies on climate change can facilitate social change when they are translated and implemented through various interventions. The most impacted nations are developing nations, which lack the resources for disaster planning, renewable energy, and adaptation. International funding that has been promised is frequently insufficient or delayed. The is the need for consented effort to address climate change issues across the globe.

Many solutions are designed far from the communities that are most affected. They arrive ready-made, without understanding local realities, languages, or rhythms of life. This creates a kind of technological dependency that reproduces old inequalities. We also overlook forms of knowledge that could genuinely help ; indigenous practices, low-tech innovations, community-based models, and the ecological wisdom already alive in many cultures.

While the world recognizes that climate change is real, many people still see it as a distant problem, not something that affects their daily lives.

In Africa, and particularly in Zambia, the consequences of this gap are clear. Many communities lack knowledge about climate change, and immediate needs like cooking fuel, charcoal, or land for farming often take priority. This drives deforestation, soil degradation, and worsening floods and droughts, showing how short-term survival can unintentionally harm the environment.

Globally, another major hurdle is the lack of coordinated, practical planning. International agreements exist, but translating them into locally relevant strategies is challenging. Limited resources, technical capacity, and infrastructure make sustainable energy, agriculture, and water management difficult to implement.

Finally, climate change hits the most vulnerable hardest those who contribute least to emissions often suffer the most.

While AI is often hailed as a tool for advancing environmental governance (improving enforcement, modeling, and compliance) it is, in reality, one of the most pressing environmental challenges. The rapid growth of AI, especially LLMs and generative systems, has led to a dramatic increase in energy and water consumption, particularly through expansion of hyperscale data centers, often situated in regions with inadequate environmental oversight.

Despite the growing awareness of AI's ecological footprint, legal and policy discussions fail to acknowledge AI�s environmental harm. This disconnect presents a significant risk to climate action, as regulations may inadvertently support the unsustainable growth of digital infrastructure. The challenge, therefore, is to first, recognize and incorporate AI�s environmental impact into climate policy; and second, updating regulatory frameworks to address this rapidly expanding sector. This includes integrating AI infrastructure into environmental impact assessments, adapting emissions trading systems to account for digital emissions, and developing international standards for digital infrastructure transparency.

Without such regulatory shifts, environmental law risks becoming a passive enabler of unsustainable technological expansion, undermining the very ecological goals it aims to protect.

While extreme heat is often seen as just �hot weather,� it is actually a silent driver behind many climate crises triggering droughts, worsening air pollution, increasing wildfire risks, reducing crop yields, and placing immense stress on urban infrastructure. 

This leads to a significant gap between people and climate action. Most individuals understand the need for mitigation, but very few recognize how urgently we need adaptation. As a result, adaptation strategies such as heat early-warning systems, resilient cooling, urban design changes, and localized climate tools remain underprioritized.

At the same time, there is a growing disconnect between technology, policy, and community needs. While innovative solutions exist, policymaking is slow, fragmented, and often not grounded in local realities. Vulnerable populations especially in the Global South face limited resources, insufficient data, and low awareness, making it harder for them to prepare for extreme heat and related crises.

The biggest challenge for climate action today is that we are not acting fast enough. Many people know climate change is real and dangerous, but governments and companies are still slow to reduce pollution. We continue using a lot of fossil fuels like coal and oil, even though they cause global warming.

Another challenge is that climate change is not fair. The people who suffer the most � such as small farmers, young people, and poor communities � are not the ones causing the problem. They face drought, floods, and food shortages, but they do not have enough money or support to protect themselves or adapt.

There is also a problem with information. Some people do not believe climate change is serious, or they do not understand what they can do to help. This makes it harder to push for strong climate policies.

To solve these challenges, we need leaders who are committed to protecting the environment. We need more investment in clean energy, better farming methods, and education so everyone understands their role. We must include communities and young people in decisions, because climate solutions must work for everyone.

We are trying to fix a market failure with tools that the market currently rejects.
This economic inertia is compounded by political short-termism.

2432,"For me, the biggest challenge for climate action today is not funding�although it matters�but the gap between awareness and real action. We talk a lot about climate change, but when it comes to implementing solutions on the ground, we face resistance from governments, institutions, and even communities.

Many governments still treat climate action as a secondary priority, something �optional� rather than urgent. Policies exist, but enforcement is weak, coordination is slow, and political shifts often stop good initiatives before they begin. Without strong governmental support, youth and civil society efforts stay limited, no matter how motivated we are.

Another major challenge is community knowledge and acceptance. In many places, people still see climate change as distant or irrelevant to their daily lives. This lack of understanding creates resistance to adaptation measures, sustainable practices, or environmental regulations. If people don�t see why climate action matters, they will stand aginst it.

Finally, there is a deep issue of fatigue and frustration among young people. We work hard, volunteer, and advocate, yet we often feel unheard at higher decision-making levels.",0.41091585,0.32902992,0.40890193,0.7806604583405763,#f3a134
2433,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between global climate policies and the practical needs of communities who face the strongest impacts. Many climate strategies are created at an international level, but they often do not reach regions dealing with drought, food insecurity, weak infrastructure, and limited resources. As a result, the people most affected by climate change struggle to adapt and recover.

Another major challenge is the lack of coordination among governments, humanitarian actors, local institutions, and the private sector. Climate change affects many areas at once transport, agriculture, health, water, and energy but responses are often fragmented. From my experience in logistics and operations, I have seen how poor coordination slows down support and makes communities more vulnerable.

A third challenge is insufficient investment in climate-resilient systems, such as strong supply chains, safe facilities, sustainable energy, and modern technologies. Many developing regions rely on outdated systems that cannot withstand climate shocks, making crises worse when they occur.

Finally, climate action is slowed by limited awareness and access to information. Communities cannot take protective action if they lack knowledge, skills, or tools.

To overcome these challenges, climate action must become more inclusive, better coordinated, and grounded in local realities so that solutions create real and lasting impact.",0.6409106,0.4756329,0.8065258,0.7833041049863312,#f3a134
2434,"For me, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the deep gap between what we know should be done and what societies are actually prepared to do. In many countries, especially in the Global South, climate change is still not understood. People are not taught about rising temperatures, extreme heat waves, water scarcity, or how rapidly shifting climate patterns directly affect their health, agriculture, and overall quality of life. Everyone is focused on surviving, so climate change becomes a distant issue even if they are the first ones impacted.

At the same time, industries that pollute the most often hold the power. They benefit from activities like fossil fuel extraction or heavy industry, while the communities who suffer the consequences have the least influence and the fewest resources.

Financial limitations are another major barrier. Action requires investment, but many developing countries simply do not have the funds. Without support, even the most urgent projects cannot be properly realized.

Finally, effective climate action needs coordination. Governments, ministries, local communities, and NGOs must work together under strong policies.

In many countries, especially across the Global South, the problem is intensified by weak enforcement, limited transparency, and the difficulty of regulating powerful industries. In India, for example, climate action is still fighting for consistent space in mainstream policy discussions, despite increasing climate impacts. As a result, the responsibility often shifts to individuals, civil society, and informal sectors. Larger structural drivers remain unaddressed.

Real progress requires stronger accountability, clearer regulation, and a shift in responsibility toward those who have the greatest capacity and the highest historical contribution to emissions.

2441,"The most significant barrier to comprehensive climate action is the continued dominance of the linear industrial model, often described as �take�make�dispose.� This model generates large-scale, systemic waste and drives rapid depletion of natural resources. While many policies now target energy-related emissions, the embodied carbon and material inefficiencies built into current production and consumption patterns remain largely unaddressed and undermine global climate ambitions.

This challenge is not only an environmental or waste-management issue; it is also a structural economic inefficiency. Global industrial systems produce billions of tonnes of waste each year, including complex and hazardous materials, a large share of which ends up in landfills, releasing methane and other greenhouse gases. This constant flow of materials requires intensive extraction, processing, and transport, which increases energy demand and contributes to the loss of forests, soils, and other natural carbon sinks.

A strategic response is to apply the principles of industrial ecology, particularly through the development of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs). EIPs convert the waste problem into an opportunity for resource efficiency by enabling industrial symbiosis. In such parks, the heat, water, and material by-products from one facility become key inputs for another, creating more circular, closed-loop systems.

2443,"I think the biggest challenge in climate action is that we cannot replace fossil fuels quickly. Our modern world majorly depends on fossils for production of electricity , transportation and all other daily activities. We want to shift to clean energy but currently we don�t have any perfect source of energy that can replace fossil fuels fast, cheaply, and on a very large scale.
Renewable energy is helpful but it also has few limitations. For example solar and wind power depend on weather and need large storage units, and these units are formed from lithium batteries. And mining  for these lithium batteries causes pollution . So in any way directly or indirectly all these sources cause pollution . Even the electricity which we call clean energy needs burning of fossil fuels for production , so it�s not completely clean. 
This means all the alternatives have somehow directly or indirectly had a negative impact on the environment and currently we don�t have such advanced technology to replace them easily with economic pov also. 
So the biggest challenge is finding a way to move from fossil fuels to cleaner energy without harming the economy, without causing new types of pollution, and at a speed that matches the urgency of climate change.

Unequal Burden and Finance: Developing nations, which have contributed least to the crisis, bear the greatest health and economic costs (e.g., from severe drought or disease migration). There's a persistent failure by historically high-emitting nations to meet promised climate finance goals, stifling the ability of countries in the Global South to invest in necessary adaptation measures (like resilient infrastructure and climate-smart healthcare) and mitigation technologies. This forces local communities to constantly play catch-up with climate impacts rather than investing in proactive solutions.
2. Political and Economic Short-Termism: Climate action requires difficult, long-term policy shifts (e.g., phasing out fossil fuel subsidies).

2459,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between global commitments and real, practical implementation at the community level. While countries pledge to reduce emissions, protect ecosystems, and build climate resilience, many vulnerable communities�especially in low-income regions�still lack the resources, technologies, and infrastructure needed to adapt to the escalating impacts of climate change.

This gap is especially visible in the water sector. Climate change is intensifying droughts, contaminating water sources, and increasing the spread of waterborne diseases. Yet the systems required to protect communities�water treatment, monitoring, early warning systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure�are often underfunded or absent. As a result, even small climate shocks can lead to serious public health crises.

Another challenge is that climate action is frequently discussed in technical or global terms, but not translated into simple, affordable solutions that local communities can use. Many climate solutions remain expensive, complex, or difficult to scale in places with limited resources.

While climate science is advancing rapidly, the design of policies grounded with indigenous knowledge and peaceful negotiations often fail to reflect the lived experiences, constraints, and knowledge systems of the communities most affected.

Climate impacts cross sectors agriculture, health and livelihoods, yet decision-making remains siloed. Local governments and communities rarely work in coordination. Indigenous communities  and youth are central to solutions, but their voices remain underrepresented in planning and financing processes. Interventions often prioritize quick outcomes over systemic changes like strengthening social networks, or shifting consumption patterns. Building long-term resilience needs to be at the crux of climate policy which in today's world needs innovative approaches and grounded theories.

Climate innovation requires not only new technologies but new ways of collaborating, sharing power, and scaling solutions that are affordable, culturally grounded, and community-driven.

In the construction sector, which contributes nearly 40% of global carbon emissions, the challenge is even more pronounced. We already have solutions�low-carbon materials, circular design, adaptive reuse, and digital tools like BIM that reduce waste. But adoption is slow due to cost barriers, lack of awareness, limited supply chains for sustainable materials, and the absence of strong policy incentives.

2463,"I believe there is no single challenge for climate action today, but a constellation of them. We face structural issues such as inadequate policies, powerful economic interests and deeply rooted cultural practices. However, for me, the biggest challenge is the lack of real connection between people�s daily lives and climate action as it is currently designed and implemented.

Too often, climate strategies follow a �one-size-fits-all� vision of how people should live, consume and participate. This tends to centre certain regions and social groups, while leaving many communities, especially Indigenous peoples, those from the Global South, and people in vulnerable situations, feeling excluded or spoken for. When projects are not co-designed, there is little sense of ownership, understanding or trust.

Another key challenge I see is that the social and cultural dimension of climate action; the human factor. It is still not given the importance it deserves. It is often treated as an add-on, instead of the central engine of connection and visibility. For me, the integration of different models, cultures, practices and interests should play a much bigger role in climate debates to ensure that actions and transitions have a real impact.

In my view, the most urgent challenge for climate action is therefore human and relational: how we listen, how we share power, and how we make climate action feel relevant, fair and accessible in real territories and real lives.",0.42613888,0.4751119,0.5732504,0.7187101521837671,#f3a134
2464,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real implementation. Many people understand the seriousness of climate change, but limited resources, lack of education, and the belief that individual efforts don�t matter often prevent consistent action.

Another major challenge is the unequal impact of climate change. Communities in rural and low-income areas face severe consequences but have the least access to support. Tharparkar is a clear example extreme heat, recurring droughts, and water scarcity deeply affect people�s daily lives, yet the region receives very limited climate investment or sustainable solutions. Families struggle to find clean drinking water, livestock suffer, and young people grow up in an environment where basic resources are uncertain.

This inequality makes climate action difficult because the communities most affected have the least representation in policy discussions. Meanwhile, global commitments to climate goals often move slowly, with delays in implementing strong policies, renewable energy solutions, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

To overcome these challenges, we need stronger community education, inclusive decision-making, and targeted investment in vulnerable regions like Tharparkar.

In many parts of the Global South, especially across Africa, progress is limited by insufficient climate finance, weak adaptation support, and competing development pressures. Communities facing the worst impacts often have the least resources to respond, widening global inequality.

Another challenge is public engagement. Climate communication is still too technical and distant from everyday realities, leaving many people unsure of how climate change affects them or how they can be part of the solution. Without broad participation, even sound policies struggle to gain momentum.

Finally, climate action suffers from a lack of long-term political will and accountability. Short political cycles clash with the long timelines required for climate solutions, leading to slow implementation or diluted commitments.

Another major challenge is limited access to resources, especially in developing communities. Many people want to adopt cleaner practices or support sustainable solutions, but they lack funding, technology, training, or support systems that would help them make those changes effectively. Without equal access, climate action becomes uneven, and vulnerable groups face the greatest risks.

There is also a challenge in communication. Climate discussions can sometimes feel too technical or intimidating, which makes it harder for ordinary people�especially youth�to engage or see themselves as part of the solution.

2469,"Firstly, public awareness and behavioral inertia remain a major barrier in Bangladesh. Many people do not perceive the direct impact of climate change on their daily lives, so adopting eco-friendly practices or supporting sustainable projects is limited. For example, despite available waste-to-energy solutions, households and restaurants rarely separate organic waste, reducing raw material supply for projects. This lowers demand for green products and slows community-level action.
Secondly, financial and institutional support for climate initiatives is weak. Investors and businesses are hesitant to fund sustainability projects due to perceived low feasibility and uncertain returns. For instance, in EcoChar, securing large-scale funding to process water hyacinth into hydrochar was challenging, delaying scaling. Similarly, in my carbon filter project, finding customers and generating revenue was difficult because the market for emission reduction solutions is still small.
Thirdly, policy gaps and weak governance hinder climate action. While Bangladesh has climate policies, enforcement is inconsistent. For example, municipal regulations on wetland management exist, but overgrowth of invasive plants like water hyacinth remains unchecked, complicating EcoChar operations. Navigating approvals for renewable energy projects or carbon-reduction technologies requires extensive coordination with authorities, slowing down impactful interventions.

Furthermore, the global economy has been built on the back of fossil fuels, which are a major barrier to a transition to a clean energy future through significant, sustained financial investments and coherent long-range strategies; however, international cooperation on these issues has been sporadic. Because climate change intersects with so many other global crises, the solutions to the climate crisis are complex and are therefore contingent on international cooperation that is far beyond the capacity of any single country or political parties within any nation. There is a major gap in financing for climate-related initiatives. Technology for mitigation and adaptation, protection of ecosystems, and projects focused on equity and fairness require far more funding than is currently committed.

I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real, consistent action. Many people understand that climate change is a serious issue, but translating that knowledge into daily behaviour, policies, and long-term commitments is still difficult. This gap is caused by several factors that continue to slow down progress.

One major issue is the lack of accessible information and practical guidance. People often want to help but don�t always know where to start or feel their actions are too small to make a difference. At the same time, governments and institutions sometimes struggle to implement strong environmental policies because of economic pressures, limited resources, or lack of political will.

Another challenge is the unequal impact of climate change. Communities that contribute the least to global emissions are often the ones suffering the most. This creates feelings of injustice, frustration, and helplessness, making it harder to build unified action.

Overall, the biggest challenge is not the lack of solutions�we have plenty. The real struggle is getting individuals, leaders, and institutions to work together consistently, with a sense of urgency and responsibility. Closing this gap is essential if we want meaningful climate action that truly protects our planet and the people who depend on it.

The challenge is balancing climate ambition with economic stability.

My solution to chart the path forward requires a balanced quid pro quo that treats both sides as equal partners. Europe can focus on making its transition more affordable by scaling green technologies, stabilising energy markets, and strengthening supply chains in ways that reduce global costs.

Many people, especially youth, are aware of climate change but feel anxious, overwhelmed, or powerless, leading to inaction. This climate anxiety, compounded by social and economic inequalities, limits participation and reduces the impact of solutions.

Another major challenge is the lack of locally relevant approaches. Policies and initiatives are often top-down, ignoring cultural, social, and economic realities of the communities most affected by climate change. As a result, interventions are sometimes unsustainable or poorly adopted.

Additionally, there is a communication gap: scientific knowledge about climate impacts is not always accessible or relatable, leaving communities unable to connect global issues to their everyday lives.

Addressing these challenges requires holistic, inclusive approaches that integrate mental health, community empowerment, and education. Strengthening emotional resilience, creating safe spaces for dialogue, and co-creating context-specific solutions can transform anxiety into action. By linking awareness, agency, and wellbeing, climate action can become effective, equitable, and sustainable.

Families care about the environment, yet immediate survival needs sometimes push climate concerns aside. Misinformation or limited climate education leaves many unsure of which actions truly matter.

Another challenge is that climate change now affects more than ecosystems, it impacts mental health, resilience, and community stability. When people feel overwhelmed or hopeless, they disconnect from action altogether.

To me, the real task is helping communities believe that their small actions matter: planting one tree, reusing materials, reducing waste, protecting water sources, or building kitchen gardens from second-hand items.

A key part of this challenge is inadequate accessible climate education. Many are aware of climate change but unsure of what actions to take. Without localized knowledge, communities can't adapt effectively, and climate policies fail to gain widespread support. 
The vulnerable are often the affected, yet have the fewest resources to adapt.

In Nigeria, less than one in four people have heard of the SDGs, and only one in ten can explain a single goal. The people most affected by climate change don�t even know a global promise exists in their name. It�s not that they don't care, it�s that they don't know, and cannot demand accountability.

In addition, political will is often weak. Policies may exist, but implementation is slowed by limited funding, competing priorities, and institutional gaps. Climate-resilient agriculture, renewable energy, and conservation efforts remain underdeveloped despite urgency.

Globally, uneven commitment and action create coordination problems, undermining progress.

Most countries now have targets for net-zero, renewable energy, or industrial decarbonization. The harder part is turning these goals into real projects: mines, transmission lines, clean-energy factories, recycling plants, and storage infrastructure. These depend on slow and often fragmented systems for permitting, land access, community engagement, financing, and cross-border coordination.

This gap shows up in every region. Europe has strong policy frameworks but struggles with long approval timelines, supply-chain dependence, and public resistance to new infrastructure. The United States has large incentives but limited build-out capacity and uncertainty around permitting. Emerging economies face tighter budgets, higher capital costs, and the pressure to expand energy access and industry at the same time.

As a result, climate action often advances in narrow pockets rather than across the full system. Technologies exist, capital is available, and political support is higher than before, but the delivery mechanisms are slow and uneven.

In regions like Kenya, local projects face prohibitively high costs of capital, with interest rates 3-5% times those in Europe due to perceived market and political instability. This financial burden crushes the economic viability of long-term climate-critical infrastructure. Furthermore, multilateral institutions have failed to provide the necessary de-risking mechanisms, such as political risk insurance and robust currency hedging, required to attract the patient, private institutional investment needed at scale.
While the EU and others discuss net-zero, policy fragmentation and permitting complexities particularly around the logistics and permanence of CO2 sequestration and the certification of carbon credits create uncertainty.

Many people now understand that the climate crisis is real and urgent, but turning that awareness into consistent behaviour change, stronger policies, and real investment remains difficult.

From my experience and research, the major barrier behind this gap is the limited access to affordable clean solutions, especially in developing countries. Communities may want to adopt renewable energy, energy-efficient technologies, or more sustainable practices, but the cost of making these transitions is still too high for the average household. Even when people are motivated, the financial burden whether it�s the price of solar systems, smart energy devices, or green building materials often prevents them from taking action.

This challenge is worsened by the lack of inclusive financing models and support systems that make climate-friendly choices accessible to everyone. Without subsidies, grants, or community-based financing, climate solutions remain concentrated among those who can afford them, leaving vulnerable populations behind.",0.7376392,0.3623491,0.5531374,0.7772104981958167,#f3a134

Compounding to this is the systematic exclusion of youth and local communities from decision-making spaces.

This gap is rooted in profound financial inequities that stall the transition in the developing world and undermine global cooperation. 

The most visible failure lies in the realm of climate finance. Developed nations have consistently failed to deliver on their promise to mobilize $100 billion annually for developing countries, creating a vast and growing deficit, particularly for adaptation efforts. For countries like Malawi, which face immediate and devastating impacts of climate change - adaptation funding is a matter of survival, not optional development. The current reality is that the needs for adaptation finance are estimated to be 10 to 18 times higher than current flows. This deficit has two crippling effects on vulnerable countries like Malawi; it hinders Resilience and undermines Mitigation.

Even if there are policies which are  sustainable, in most cases, particularly common in Global South countries, there will be implementation gaps. This is primarily because there are gaps in governance, which gives way to power vacuums and ultimately poor implementation of climate policies.

While international agreements and national pledges set ambitious targets, the communities most vulnerable to climate impacts often lack the financing, technology, and institutional capacity needed to translate these goals into real change.

This challenge is driven by three interconnected issues. First, climate finance is insufficient, slow, and unevenly distributed. Many frontline countries struggle to access funds for adaptation, renewable energy, and resilience-building, leaving millions exposed to extreme weather, energy poverty, and health risks. Second, climate solutions are often designed without considering local realities. Policies that work in Europe may not be directly applicable in rural African contexts, where infrastructure, data systems, and governance structures differ significantly. Third, there is a growing trust deficit between global institutions and affected communities, which weakens participation and slows the adoption of climate solutions.

This creates a vicious cycle that diverts attention and resources. Governments facing immediate humanitarian emergencies may deprioritize climate policy, while affected populations are forced into survival mode. The challenge, therefore, is to break this cycle. We must advance climate solutions that are explicitly designed for conflict affected and vulnerable communities, ensuring that climate finance and adaptation strategies reach those on the frontlines.

During Norway�s experience, I learned how forward-thinking financial policies�such as sovereign wealth funds with strong ethical guidelines, green taxation, and responsible investment frameworks�can play a crucial role in balancing economic growth with environmental protection. This model shows that capitalism can be reshaped into an incentive-based system that rewards sustainability and penalizes pollution.
For the Global South, the challenge is even bigger due to limited access to green technologies, financing gaps, and structural vulnerabilities. Yet, by embracing sustainable finance and impact investing, we can mobilize capital where it is most needed, empower local communities, and strengthen climate resilience.

Climate action gets trapped in rooms filled with policies and promises, while farmers, youth, and local leaders are left to face the consequences with little backup.

Smallholder farmers, women, and youth are at the frontline of climate impacts, yet they�re often the last to receive support. If we can�t empower the people closest to the problem, then our solutions will always fall short.

There�s also the challenge of attention. Climate change feels slow until disaster hits. Many governments, institutions, and even communities struggle to stay consistent � we wait for floods, heatwaves, or losses before we act. But climate action requires steady, patient work, not panic-driven reactions.

For me, the real battle is turning climate action from awareness into daily practice � making it simple, affordable, and meaningful for ordinary people. When climate solutions become part of how we farm, build, commute, and govern, that�s when we win.

2546,"In my opinion, the lack of political will is the biggest challenge facing climate action at the moment.

The lack of political will stems from both the rise of far right movements that exacerbate the rhetoric of climate denialism on on one hand and draws politicians to adopt more radical rhetoric against climate change on the other hand to appeal to the far right electorate. 

Moreover, the lack of political will also derives from the pressures exerted by the economic big fossil fuel  lobbyist on government to slow down the transition from the brown to the green economy, as we had witnessed with the developments at COP 30. 

In addition to that, the lack of political will comes as a result from the rise of the poly crises especially security related ones (such the war in Ukraine as well as in Gaza) which shifted global politics to security and put climate action to the back burner; even though climate action remains part and parcel to security related issues. 

I must add that the lack of political will comes derives as well from the lack of meaningful representation of the voices of the frontline communities in politics. Most climate policies sideline people with disability, indigenous people, etc. This hinders the rise of people-centered approach to climate action. 

Whereas some argue that climate finance presents the biggest hurdle, I would argue that if the political will existed, both climate finance as well as technical assistance would be deployed easily.

 From supporting agri-startups in the Co-Creation Fund to writing a COP30 simulation paper on balancing climate finance between mitigation and adaptation, I have seen that without equitable and accessible funding, innovative local solutions remain small-scale and fragmented.

To tackle climate change effectively, finance mechanisms must prioritize both adaptation and mitigation, while enabling local actors to scale solutions. This means investing in capacity-building, knowledge transfer, and risk-sharing alongside direct funding. Only by linking global finance with on-the-ground innovation can we ensure that climate action is not just ambitious in theory, but effective and inclusive in practice�especially for communities in the Global South that are already bearing the brunt of climate impact",0.7026777,0.6122953,0.6795994,0.6986914596221862,#f7e379
2555,"The hardest part of climate action I�ve seen isn�t a lack of technology or money - it�s actually justice.  In the slums where I have seen children grow up I�ve watched bulldozers arrive before dawn. Armed police told my neighbors to leave, then demolished their homes for a new road. Though they have the right to a dignified life, no one cares for the community�s need and opinion.  When we gathered to protest that forced eviction, my friend was beaten and hauled off in a police van while the govt officials got scot free with state impunity. I�ve seen factories dump smoke into the air our children breathe, and government does not want to take responsibility and punishes those liable; instead the youth who film these violations, protest get charged with disturbing the peace.
In every meeting or government office, decisions about our forests, farms, or flood mitigation happen without us.  Our voices � the voices of the poor, and working class people who feel the first heat of climate change are left out of the room.  The real barriers are these power imbalances and legal double-standards.
From years of organizing, I�ve learned that climate change won�t be solved by our ideas alone, it will fail until justice is central.  The biggest challenge now is ensuring that those of us on the front lines who lose their homes, liberty and health are heard and protected.

2556,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is climate inaction. While solutions and technologies exist, political hesitation, economic barriers and limited public engagement slow the transition we urgently need.

I saw this firsthand in Pakistan�s textile sector, one of the country�s most resource-intensive industries. Despite widespread sustainability rhetoric, many factories continued using outdated machinery, inefficient water systems and fossil-fuel energy. Companies understood their environmental impact, yet change was often delayed due to financial pressures, production concerns or the belief that others should act first. This showed me that climate inaction stems less from ignorance and more from hesitation.

Inaction is reinforced at multiple levels: politically, decision-makers delay ambitious reforms; economically, industries remain locked into high-carbon models that are costly to overhaul; socially, individuals feel their efforts are too small to matter, creating a persistent value-action gap. In the textile sector, even when employees cared about sustainability, systemic barriers often stifled initiative.

Overcoming this requires more than innovation. We need collective empowerment through supportive policies, green investment for industries and a cultural shift that makes climate responsibility a shared norm. Only by breaking this cycle of inaction can we accelerate climate action at the pace the crisis demands.",0.57905173,0.22234374,0.3812741,0.7727828331051135,#f3a134

Although advancements in renewable energy, digital innovation, their implementation on a large scale is often slowed by weak political commitment, limited public awareness, lack of access to education and resistance to change. Climate change is not just a technical or environmental issue, it is also a social and behavioural issue. Many communities, particularly in developing regions, do not have the required resources to actively participate in the transition. There is also a clear inequality between the Global North and the Global South in access to technology, finance and knowledge. Without stronger international cooperation and comprehensive policies, vulnerable people will be at risk of being left behind. Through my experience leading energy transition initiatives, I have learned that technical solutions alone are not enough. I think that participation in Climate and Desertification Fresk, Climate Challenge, international programs and forums will reinforce the importance of collaboration and youth engagement. Through initiatives such as digital platforms creation, we can seek to empower young people with practical and accessible knowledge.

2558,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and practical implementation. Many people know about climate change, but translating that knowledge into consistent action, at community, national, and institutional levels, remains difficult. This gap is shaped by several factors.

First, limited access to resources and funding prevents many local communities, especially in Africa, from adopting sustainable practices or scaling up climate initiatives. Young people often have ideas but lack support to bring them to life.

Second, poor environmental education and communication make it harder for communities to understand how climate issues directly affect their daily lives. Without this understanding, climate action feels distant or less urgent.

Third, weak policies and enforcement undermine progress. Even when laws exist, poor implementation, corruption, or inadequate planning lead to ineffective climate responses.

Finally, there is the challenge of behavioural change. Simple actions like proper waste disposal, tree planting, and reducing pollution require consistent habits, which many communities struggle to adopt due to convenience, culture, or lack of awareness.

Addressing these challenges requires stronger education, better community engagement, supportive policies, and increased funding for grassroots climate solutions�especially those led by young people.",0.4468119,0.15955645,0.5660063,0.8043486910484117,#f3a134

Another challenge is that the people who suffer the most from climate change, especially in Africa, are not the ones causing it. These communities have little money, weak systems, and limited tools to protect themselves, so it is hard for them to adapt.

Lack of funding is also a big problem. Many youth-led climate projects fail to grow because there is no money, mentorship, or equipment. Good ideas stay on paper instead of becoming real solutions.

Climate misinformation and low awareness also make the problem worse. When people do not understand climate change and what they can do, they cannot make long-term changes.

Countries in the Global South including Pakistan are among the most climate-vulnerable, yet they receive only a small fraction of the funding, technology transfer, and capacity-building support required to build resilience. This imbalance makes it extremely difficult for developing nations to invest in early-warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable energy transitions, and long-term adaptation strategies.
After the 2022 Pakistan floods, which caused massive displacement and economic loss, it became clear to me how strongly climate injustice persists. Even though Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global emissions, the aid it received was far below the scale of destruction. This disparity is not unique many countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America struggle with limited climate finance, inadequate research infrastructure, and insufficient institutional capacity. As someone who worked on a flood-prediction model during that time, I saw firsthand how the lack of data and resources restricts local innovation.

2562,"  Based on current data and the consensus from major 2024-2025 climate reports, the single biggest challenge for climate action today is the ""Implementation Gap.""

While the world has largely agreed on the science (we know climate change is happening) and the targets (Net Zero, 1.5�C), we are failing to bridge the divide between promises and reality. This gap manifests in two critical ways:

The Finance Deficit: Developing nations�who contribute the least to emissions but suffer the most�are not receiving the funds promised to them. The 2025 Adaptation Gap Report highlights a ""yawning gap"" where adaptation needs are 10�18 times greater than current public finance flows. Without capital, the Global South cannot transition to green energy or build resilience against disasters.


Political Inertia: Despite signing agreements, many governments prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term survival. The UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025 warns that current policies put us on track for a catastrophic 2.6�3.1�C rise. The technology to fix this exists (renewables are cheaper than ever), but fossil fuel lobbying and political hesitation stall the necessary rapid phase-out.

In short, the challenge is no longer about what to do, but finding the political courage and financial solidarity to actually do it before the window of opportunity closes.",0.9769676,0.26778907,0.5625082,0.8623837395674692,#e51f1f

Climate change is accelerating faster than adaptation efforts, creating a growing resilience gap. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, water scarcity and desertification, despite contributing the least to global emissions. A lack of accessible climate finance, data infrastructure and technological transfer slows down efforts to implement sustainable solutions on a large scale. Another major challenge is the limited integration of technology and innovation into climate strategies. Tools such as AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), satellite monitoring and digital twins have the potential to transform climate prediction, early warning systems and resource management, but they remain underutilised in many regions due to cost and a lack of expertise.

2564,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is tackling the misunderstanding of the indigenous people, companies and individuals on woodcut consequences destroying wildlife and fuelling the global warming.

The woodcut for instance has been relentless within my country. In spite of being a source of survival for natives, over decades we've witnessed an intensive woodcut across our forests for commercial ends.

Despite the advent of renewable energies, only a handful of households make use of them throughout the country due to the limited means, preferring to use charcoal and wood at their reach for cooking.

For sure that is a big issue added to the fact that different armed groups have taken over some territories within our forests, exploiting them and threatening the entire wildlife.

To tackle this challenge and help preserve our climate, there is need of a complete action stemming from strong Government policy to protect our environment, to plant trees, to guarantee peace and quality life for citizens

Implementing these strategies would help shift the mentality of people who rely on our forests for survival.

2565,"One of the biggest barriers to effective climate action in my country and across much of the Global South is the limited participation of people with low literacy levels. Many climate change programs rely heavily on written information, technical language, or formal platforms that unintentionally exclude a large portion of the population. As a result, many people believe that climate change is a distant or abstract issue that does not directly affect their daily lives, even though they are often the most vulnerable to its impacts.

This gap in understanding leads to minimal involvement in activities such as waste management, tree planting, water conservation, and sustainable farming practices. To address this challenge, climate sensitization must be intensified and redesigned to suit community realities. Communication should be practical, visual, and delivered in local languages through community meetings, radio programs, drama, and peer education.

Furthermore, creative, incentive-based approaches at the household level�such as reward systems for proper waste disposal, community competitions, and income-generating green activities�can motivate participation. When people are empowered with knowledge and see direct social or economic benefits, climate action shifts from being a distant agenda to a shared community responsibility, strengthening the fight against climate change from the grassroots upward.",0.29900193,0.4227634,0.34736097,0.5985160916683535,#f7e379

However, we lack the infrastructure, funding, and policy support needed to turn this awareness into real, scalable action.

Economic pressure makes this worse. For many families, daily survival comes before long-term environmental protection. Practices like gas flaring or dumping waste often continue not because people do not care, but because there are no cheaper or accessible alternatives. Sustainable options usually come with high upfront costs that communities cannot manage.

There is also a coordination problem. Grassroots efforts, like my neighbourhood cleanups, often happen in isolation. People are working hard, but they are working alone, and as a result local progress rarely connects to broader national strategies.

Closing this gap requires more than awareness campaigns. We need technical support, accessible funding for youth-led projects, and platforms that connect local innovators to wider networks.

This is a great concern for countries in the Global South who bear the burnout of the climate crisis. Hence, in my perspective, the most serious challenge for climate action today is the persistent disconnect between global financial commitments and the ability of vulnerable communities to access those funding. This challenge continues to huge role in worsening poverty and vulnerability for marginalised, climate-affected communities in the global south.
For example, in my country, Nigeria, women smallholder farmers contribute 60�80% of Nigeria�s food supply (FAO 2022), yet they cannot afford the tools to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. As post-harvest loss, droughts, and extreme heat continue to intensify, these women are trapped in poverty, which limits their agricultural productivity and frustrates their financial independence, and increases their dependence on their male partners. This, in turn, reduces their bargaining power within the homefront and makes them more vulnerable to gender-based violence. Despite contributing largely to food production, very little climate funding reaches them.
This imbalance reflects a broader societal issue, with climate change strengthening inequality. Addressing this issue requires that climate finance go beyond commitments to actual disbursement to reach vulnerable farmers in the global south.",0.60831,0.62994087,0.6500609,0.637286893801228,#f7e379

At the heart of this gap is inequality. Climate change does not affect everyone equally, yet the communities who contribute the least to the crisis are the ones facing the harshest consequences. Meanwhile, those with the greatest power to drive systemic change frequently prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term sustainability. This imbalance delays action and reinforces existing injustices.

Another key barrier is communication. Climate issues are still seen as abstract, complex, or distant from everyday life. When people do not feel personally connected to the problem, it becomes harder to mobilize them around solutions.

2571,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening gap between available climate finance and actual investment needs. While global climate finance volumes are increasing, they remain far below what is required to meet the Paris Agreement. A key obstacle is the difficulty of aligning financial flows with climate goals. The absence of standardised methods, indicators and data systems makes it hard for both public and private actors to assess risks, measure impacts, and direct capital toward genuinely sustainable activities. Without clear, comparable information, the transition cannot scale.

Another major challenge is the persistent framing that pits sustainability against economic competitiveness. This false opposition weakens political ambition and slows down implementation. What is needed is a reframing of climate action as a driver of innovation, resilience and long-term competitiveness. I am particularly interested in exploring how policy and market design can incentivise this shift and make sustainability a strategic advantage rather than a perceived burden.

But here's where it gets tricky: nations often disagree sharply on how responsibilities should be shared. Developing countries point out that wealthier nations produced most historical emissions while building their prosperity, so they should shoulder more of the burden now and help fund green transitions. Meanwhile, industrialized countries are reluctant to take on higher costs if major emerging economies continue expanding their emissions without similar commitments.

This challenge is also influenced by the infrastructure trap, where countries with decades of investment in fossil fuel systems face enormous economic disruption in shifting away from them. Countries worry that strict climate policies like carbon taxes or renewable energy mandates could hinder their industries in global competition, leading to job losses or economic slowdowns.

Political interests make it hard for countries to work together on climate change because leaders often focus on domestic concerns over global action. Distrust between nations makes international agreements weak, leading to a lack of climate action.

2584,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the widening gap between global climate commitments and real, on-the-ground implementation, especially in the Global South. While international agreements highlight ambition, many communities continue to face limited financing, weak governance structures, and inadequate access to technology. As a result, climate policies do not always translate into tangible benefits for those most affected by climate impacts.

A major driver of this gap is the persistent inequality in climate financing and decision-making power. Countries and communities that contribute the least to global emissions often have the least influence in shaping climate solutions, and yet they bear the greatest burden of droughts, floods, food insecurity, and loss of biodiversity. Without fair access to resources, many local organisations, youth networks, women�s groups, and grassroots leaders cannot scale their work even though they are closest to the problem and often have the most practical, context-driven solutions.

Another major challenge is the insufficient integration of climate education and public awareness, which limits meaningful participation and slows adoption of sustainable practices. Young people, in particular, are eager to engage but lack platforms, training, and support.

Ultimately, the biggest challenge is ensuring that climate action is just, inclusive, and locally owned, rather than driven only from global centres of power.",0.63388777,0.40662253,0.8641381,0.8063532908214402,#f3a134
2585,"I think the biggest challenge for climate action today is the interplay between limited local capacity, social inequality, and environmental degradation. While global awareness of climate issues is growing, translating commitments into actionable solutions at the community level remains a challenge. Most interventions fail to address the systemic hurdles that keep people from fully participating in different climate actions. 
            For instance, in informal settlements, plastic pollution is not just an environmental problem. It affects social well-being, health, and economic opportunities. Without proper support, communities struggle to implement sustainable practices. Besides, youth-led initiatives often struggle to scale their impact due to limited mentorship, funding, and policy support.
            Addressing the above challenges requires integrated solutions that put together environmental, economic, and social objectives. It also demands capacity-building for local actors to enable communities to lead climate interventions independently. Through my work with beVisioneers, I have observed how practical, community-centered approaches can reduce pollution, improve living conditions, and create jobs. 
            Conclusively, the challenge is not just the climate crisis itself, but making sure that solutions are inclusive, sustainable, and equitable.

We have the necessary technologies for CO2 removal, their deployment is fatally hindered by the financial ecosystem. The core issue is the high-risk premium applied to crucial clean-tech infrastructure in developing nations, making projects unbankable.
In regions like Kenya, local projects face prohibitively high costs of capital, with interest rates 3-5% times those in Europe due to perceived market and political instability. This financial burden crushes the economic viability of long-term climate-critical infrastructure. Furthermore, multilateral institutions have failed to provide the necessary de-risking mechanisms, such as political risk insurance and robust currency hedging, required to attract the patient, private institutional investment needed at scale.
While the EU and others discuss net-zero, policy fragmentation and permitting complexities particularly around the logistics and permanence of CO2 sequestration and the certification of carbon credits create uncertainty. This inconsistency deters the massive, long-term commitments required. Until global North policy frameworks successfully de-risk these essential investments and channel capital at concessional rates toward proven technologies in regions most affected, the goal of net-zero will remain just an ambition.",0.7853086,0.5358536,0.6560967,0.7301750031787877,#f3a134

The urgent global environmental goals for rapid decarbonization conflicts directly with short political cycles and profound economic dependencies on fossil fuels. This is compounded by inequities between countries: developing nations often prioritize economic growth and poverty reduction, while wealthier nations have historically contributed most to the emission.
This challenge is further complicated by issues of natural resource governance. While scientific consensus is that rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are critical, translating this knowledge into actionable policies and implementation at local level is complicated. Additionally, the loss of local connection and authority over natural environments leads to suboptimal stewardship, accelerating deforestation and undermining a key natural climate solution. Individual action remains a key narrative in climate campaigns. Individual behavioral change, while important, cannot substitute for systemic policy shifts

We have the science and the solutions, but climate change demands deep, structural changes that require sustained commitment over decades. Our political systems, however, are geared towards short-term gains, four-year election cycles, and immediate economic results.

This creates a massive gap. Politicians are often reluctant to impose necessary, sometimes unpopular, policies like carbon taxes or phasing out fossil fuels. The immediate economic disruption might cost them the next election, even if the long-term benefit is essential for the planet.

Furthermore, this short-term focus fuels the problem of ""Climate Justice."" Developed nations are slow to provide the necessary funding and technology transfer to developing nations, slowing down unified global action.

Ultimately, the challenge is not scientific; it's one of governance and human psychology. We need to find a way to incentivize political leaders and corporations to prioritize the survival of the next generation over the profits of the next quarter. Until we bridge that gap between short-term self-interest and long-term planetary health, we will continue to fall short of our climate goals.

While scientific consensus and high-level policy frameworks are crucial, they often fail to translate into sustained, widespread public ownership and behavioral change at the community level.

For many, climate change remains an abstract, distant threat, overshadowed by immediate economic pressures and daily survival. This creates a critical implementation gap. Policies and technologies can be designed, but without deep-rooted public buy-in and a clear understanding of local co-benefits�such as job creation, improved health, and energy security�they risk stagnation or resistance.

This challenge is evident in my own work. Raising awareness about plastic pollution is one thing; fostering a lasting cultural shift towards reusables is another. My research into local solutions for water hyacinth was driven by the need to make climate adaptation directly relevant and beneficial to the communities affected. The true hurdle is not a lack of solutions, but a lack of contextualized frameworks that empower individuals and communities to see themselves not as victims of the crisis, but as active, essential agents of the solution. Bridging this gap requires hyper-local communication, co-design of projects with communities, and consistently demonstrating the immediate, positive impact of climate action on people's lives.

Across Africa, millions still lack electricity or rely on traditional biomass for cooking. Youth-led solutions like biogas, solar and clean cooking technologies often remain small-scale due to limited resources, networks, technical support, and policy influence. Even technically viable solutions can fail if communities do not understand or trust them. 

Fragmented policies and insufficient financing also slow the adoption of low-carbon energy systems. Addressing this requires innovation, advocacy, and collaboration linking young innovators, communities, policymakers and investors to make solutions practical, acceptable and financially viable.

Communities face hurricanes, droughts, and coastal erosion, yet the funding, training, and technical assistance needed to respond often arrive late or in forms that do not match local needs. Another challenge is the limited inclusion of those who understand the problem most clearly. Young people, local organisations, and community leaders have experience that could strengthen project design and delivery, but they are not consistently integrated into planning or evaluation. This leads to climate projects that look good on paper but struggle in practice. There is also a trust gap.

This inequality restricts their ability to adapt and recover.

The Gender Snapshot 2024 report warns that by 2050, climate change could push up to 158 million more women and girls into poverty, compared to 142 million men and boys. Women�s unequal participation in climate governance and labour markets compounds these risks, preventing them from fully contributing to climate planning and implementation. Despite frameworks like the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan, progress remains slow, and gender-responsive climate finance is still limited.

Addressing this challenge requires embedding gender equality into every aspect of climate action: from mitigation and adaptation strategies to financing and technology transfer.

This damages confidence in the process and derails actual change.

I have witnessed this divide being detrimental in Nigeria and other Global South. It is difficult to implement climate solutions in many developing nations, which require longterm funding, and these projects do not necessarily lead to immediate gains as would be wanted by our leading class. On the same note, the Global North countries delay decisive action on this matter.
I believe that international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, should be translated into grounded and inclusive actions backed by political will.

The Ideas Lab 2026 would allow me to gain knowledge by interacting with experts and other young leaders. I would like to share my grassroots experiences in Nigeria. Also my experience as a young negotiator in the climate change space. 

After this program, I would like to carry with me actionable plans on how to bridge the gaps between international commitment on climate actions at the local level. I would like to advocate climate responses that save forests, lives and our future.

Many people understand that climate change is a serious threat, but translating this awareness into effective action at local, national, and international levels remains difficult. Several factors contribute to this challenge.
First, limited funding and resources make it hard for vulnerable communities�especially in developing countries�to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies. These communities face the worst impacts, such as floods, droughts, and food insecurity, yet often lack the financial support needed for climate-resilient infrastructure and environmental protection.
Second, weak policy enforcement and slow government decision-making hinder progress. Even when climate policies exist, they are not always enforced due to political interests, corruption, or lack of institutional capacity.
Third, there is a major challenge of public awareness and behavior change. Many people still engage in practices that harm the environment, such as cutting trees for fuel, improper waste disposal, and overuse of natural resources. Without strong community involvement, climate action cannot succeed.
Finally, global climate negotiations often face inequality and disagreement, as wealthier nations contribute more emissions while poorer countries suffer the greatest impacts.",0.63975215,0.07077652,0.47950363,0.8574582845890342,#e51f1f

Kenya actually has robust environmental laws, such as the Climate Change Act and the Environmental Management and Co-ordination Act. Yet, as a legal researcher, I see a ""crisis of implementation."" In my own community, industrial effluent flows unchecked into rivers despite clear regulations prohibiting it. We have excellent policies on paper, but a lack of political will and resources for enforcement turns vulnerable neighborhoods into sacrifice zones.

Finally, there is a financial bottleneck. While Kenya attracts climate finance, it rarely reaches the grassroots level. Community-based organizations (CBOs) like the glass recycling initiative I co-founded struggle to access the capital needed to scale, while large-scale funds get absorbed by bureaucracy.

Another challenge is global inequality. Some countries produce most emissions, while others suffer the strongest impacts. This makes cooperation harder and slows down global solutions. In addition, misinformation and low climate education prevent communities from supporting environmental policies or taking action.

Climate action also needs stronger participation from youth and local communities. Many solutions exist, but they require people to be aware, engaged, and ready to change behaviors.

In Jordan, the challenge is even greater. The country faces extreme water scarcity, rising temperatures, and increasing pressure on natural resources.

This is a common knowledge that I believe have not been fully grasped. For instance, before 2011, Bitcoin as a digital currency was inexistent. However, even as an amazing invention for humanity, it came with energy problems due to how much computing (that produces massive carbon emissions) needed to create it � the same thing happens Artificial Intelligence. So, I believe in-depth awareness is still lacking, otherwise there would have been better pushback on some inventions. While the level of awareness varies, I think the ignorance is worse in developing countries because I have come to observe that people in these regions are more concerned by other immediate social issues like poverty � climate seem like a luxurious problem, and to some too complex to explain in simple terms.

In my own view and opinion, I believe one of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the lack of collective action and global cooperation. Climate change is a global problem that requires a unified response, but unfortunately, many countries are still prioritizing their own interests over the need for collective action.

The divide between developed and developing countries is particularly concerning. Developing countries are often left to bear the brunt of climate impacts, despite contributing relatively little to global emissions. Meanwhile, developed countries are often slow to provide climate finance and support, exacerbating the problem.

Additionally, many individuals and communities are still not taking sufficient action to reduce their carbon footprint, whether it's due to lack of awareness, lack of resources, or simply a lack of concern. This lack of individual action is mirrored at the national and international levels, where many governments are failing to implement policies that prioritize climate action.

To overcome these challenges, I believe we need a fundamental shift in how we approach climate action. We need to recognize that climate change is a global problem that requires a global response, and that we must work together to support each other in reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change.",0.51827526,0.32162857,0.3003627,0.7549797961173276,#f3a134

Most vulnerable countries, especially in the Global South, are expected to meet ambitious climate goals while lacking the data, financing access, and policy leverage that wealthier countries take for granted.

This creates a structural gap: decisions about climate risk, funding priorities, and ecosystem value are made with incomplete or uneven information. Without robust and shared data systems, frontline countries cannot prove their needs, track ecosystem change, or make a strong case for investment. As a result, climate action becomes reactive instead of strategic, and communities most affected by climate change remain underrepresented in global policymaking.

Addressing climate change ultimately requires more than technology�it requires fair governance, transparent data, and systems that allow vulnerable countries to participate as equal partners.

Despite ambitious commitments made during international conferences, emissions continue to rise in several key sectors such as energy, transport, agriculture, and industry. This paradox shows how deep the gap remains between announced promises and the measures actually implemented. Reducing greenhouse gases requires a major transformation of economic and social systems, which remains difficult for many countries, especially those lacking technology or financing.

A concrete example is methane, a particularly powerful greenhouse gas. Several countries have pledged to significantly cut their methane emissions by 2030, especially in the agricultural and gas sectors. Yet in practice, leaks continue, monitoring systems remain insufficient, and funding to modernize infrastructures is still lacking. This gap reveals how complex it is to turn a political commitment into concrete and measurable actions on the ground.

Added to this are entrenched economic interests, a lack of international coordination, and deep inequalities in access to clean solutions.

In addition to that, countries in the Global South are strongly affected by climate change, yet their voices are often not fully included in international decisions due to several factors. Such a lack of equal participation issue makes climate solutions less fair and in some worse cases, less effective.

While frameworks such as the Paris Agreement, the European Green Deal, and COP30 adaptation commitments set bold targets, implementation is slowed by insufficient financing, weak local institutional capacity, and the structural inequalities shaping the global climate regime.

Funding remains the most critical bottleneck. Current climate finance flows fall far below the USD 300 billion needed annually for adaptation by 2030, while access barriers prevent developing countries from utilising even the limited funds available. At the same time, loss and damage continue to escalate, especially in regions like the Sahel where rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and ecosystem degradation fuel conflict and displacement.

Noteworthy to mention is the challenge of disconnect between global policymaking spaces and youth voices from affected regions. Young leaders often lack the platforms, networks, and technical exposure needed to influence climate governance.

Addressing these gaps requires a fairer climate?finance architecture, stronger EU�Africa policy coordination, and greater investment in youth?led knowledge systems � an efforts I am committed to drive through research, advocacy, and collaborative initiatives in my present master�s program and beyond.

Yet, communities in the DRC are affected by floods, heatwaves, food insecurity, and the destruction of natural ecosystems. These communities lack resources and support to adapt to the changing climate.

Another major problem is that most climate decisions are made far from the people who are most affected. Youth, local leaders, and vulnerable groups are rarely included in the planning and decision-making. This creates a gap between policies and real-life needs on the ground.

Funding and policy decisions are typically driven by short-term, measurable costs and benefits, as well as the impact on damaged infrastructure, GDP loss, and cost-benefit ratios. This pushes governments and donors toward projects that produce quick, countable outputs, while underinvesting in impacts that are harder to measure, such as cultural loss, mental health, disrupted education, loss of safety and identity, or the slow erosion of social cohesion.

In places like Nepal, families face disasters such as landslides, floods, and drought as a full social crisis, not just an economic one. Ancestral land, rituals, language, and community bonds can be permanently damaged, yet these non-economic losses rarely appear in project appraisals or funding priorities. This is exactly why my PhD focuses on non-economic loss and damage to make these invisible impacts visible and meaningful for policy and practice.

At the same time, there is a growing adaptation gap and emerging adaptation limits: even where plans exist, actions and finance fall far short, and in some places, people can no longer fully avoid loss and damage, only cope with it. Bridging this gap and recognizing these limits is essential for more just and realistic climate action.

Despite global ambitions to keep temperatures within the 1.5�C limit, many fossil fuel-producing countries continue to focus on mitigating emissions from combustion rather than reducing fossil fuel production itself. As the Earth warms at an unprecedented rate, the disruption of natural systems poses many risks to humans and all other forms of life.

Young children lack an outlet to process, articulate, and critically engage with their experiences of climate change in many of its manifestations. This disempowerment hampers their ability to imagine or contribute to solutions for Africa.

92% of children in Tanzania are affected by climate risk, yet 50% of Standard Seven pupils cannot read a Standard Two English textbook. Without robust reading comprehension cultivated in early grades, these children lack the early cognitive tools to fully grasp why their own environment is changing or to effectively engage with, let alone contribute to, truly African solutions that prioritise regeneration and sustainability over external metrics.

Their actions embolden promoters of unsustainable habits like deforestation of the Amazon, using coal energy, and the increased drilling of oil and gas. Although there is general awareness of climate change among contemporary generations, placing climate deniers at the heart of global policy hinders progress. For instance, impressive projects on renewable energy, forest conservation, community awareness programs, and protecting vulnerable communities have been shelved. In certain situations, climate-related diseases like malaria and yellow fever are re-emerging due to scaling down of effective funding programs. Severe outcomes include community rejection of carbon offsetting projects where local communities were bound to benefit in many fundamental ways.

Very little know plastic can release greenhouse gases while it degrade in the ocean. Also the marine eco systems get damaged with the continuous plastic, polythene debris. If they really care and know the impact will they even throw these here and there. I think every initiative should comes with the behavioral change otherwise whatever we do is pointless. 
I think 2 years back we did a project in a village in Galle (Dadalla), with an awareness and a clean up. We had to clean a land full of garbage which people used throw their trash. We invited all the villagers to join hands with us in cleaning which lead them to understand how bad what they have done and how hard these university students working voluntarily cleaning it up for them. After 2 years we got some snaps that villagers have planted flower trees and other plants there and maintaining the land in a proper manner.

Cities also face very different realities. Many in developing economies deal with informality, inequality, weak infrastructure and limited financial resources, while already suffering floods, heat and pollution. European cities may have more resources, but often face social tensions, higher costs and political pushback when turning plans into projects. Across regions, access to finance is a common bottleneck.

Financing climate action and a just transition is also a geopolitical challenge. Countries experience climate impacts in different ways and have contributed very differently to the problem � those most affected often have the least resources.

For me, the central challenge is to align climate action with justice and everyday realities: making finance and regulations accessible to local governments in different regions, advancing a credible transition away from fossil fuels, and creating real space for traditional populations and local communities in decision making.

Limited technical capacity, weak institutional linkages and competing development priorities often delay action even when the evidence is urgent.

In my work on air pollution monitoring, I have seen how valuable environmental data can remain underused because decision-makers lack accessible interpretation, cross-sector collaboration or the resources needed to implement interventions. This disconnect slows progress on mitigation, adaptation and public health protection.

Another major challenge is that global climate solutions often overlook local contexts. Communities most affected by climate impacts frequently have the least influence on policy design, leading to strategies that do not fully match their realities.

Overall, the biggest challenge is bridging the gap between awareness, understanding, and sustained community action. To move forward, climate communication must be relatable, solutions must be accessible, and people must be empowered to see themselves as essential actors in the climate solution.

India experiences diverse climate vulnerability, with the north facing glacial retreat and landslides, its agrarian communities in the river belt experiencing erratic monsoon, the coastal communities facing salt intrusion and cyclones, while its urban population reels with extreme heat, flooding and water stresses. 

India has significantly accelerated implementation in the renewable energy space, however, investment in adaptation and resilience has a long way to catch up. This is mostly because of these initiatives can take longer to show results and hence aren�t viable investment choices for government or businesses that are looking for quicker impact stories. 

What the Global South needs is finance that is accessible for the communities to lead initiatives for building resilience based on their lived realities, whether its is coping with heat stress or the impact on their crops. In addition, what we also need are stronger evaluation systems in place that allow stories of resilience that compliment data to be captured, in turn aiding advocacy for more finance.

This disconnect slows progress and widens inequalities in climate resilience.

Another key challenge is the integration of technology and innovation into climate solutions in a way that is inclusive and context-sensitive. While AI, digital tools, and scientific advances offer unprecedented opportunities, their benefits are often concentrated in regions with existing infrastructure and expertise, leaving marginalized communities behind. 

Additionally, climate action requires collaboration across sectors, countries, and disciplines, yet coordination is often fragmented. Policymakers, innovators, scientists, and communities may work in silos, resulting in duplicated efforts or solutions that are not scalable.

As a packaging technology professional, I see climate action as requiring a holistic approach to the packaging lifecycle from design and material selection to production, distribution, and disposal. Developing affordable, recyclable, and biodegradable alternatives is essential, but scaling them is difficult without technical expertise, industry collaboration, and supportive policies.
Climate solutions must also align with supply chains, community needs, and cultural contexts to achieve real impact. The challenge lies not only in creating eco-friendly materials but in making them practical, accessible, and widely adopted.

Water scarcity, food insecurity, and extreme weather events compound existing inequalities, limiting the ability of communities to adapt and participate in sustainable development.

Another critical challenge is the gap between policy and practice. While global and national climate policies exist, implementation often falters due to weak governance, limited resources, and lack of inclusive participation. This disconnect prevents innovative solutions from reaching local communities and slows the systemic changes needed to achieve climate resilience.

While trillions are pledged internationally, only a fraction trickles down to the grassroots innovators and communities who are most affected and possess invaluable contextual knowledge.

From my work with smallholder farmers, I see this daily. They bear the brunt of climate change but face immense barriers in accessing the funds and technologies needed to adapt. The problem is twofold: 1) Inaccessible Funding Structures: Complex application procedures and rigid requirements exclude small-scale, agile organizations. 2) A ""Solution-Pushing"" Model: Often, externally designed technologies are deployed without deep community integration, leading to low adoption and wasted resources.

The result is a vast implementation gap. We have global commitments and local needs, but a missing middle layer of effective distribution and trust-based partnership.

The solution lies in re-engineering climate finance to be bottom-up. This means creating simplified, direct funding vehicles for community-based organizations, leveraging local networks (like farmer cooperatives) for distribution, and mandating co-design in project development.

On paper, multilateral agreements are ambitious. In practice, the transition is asymmetric. Wealthy countries retain control over key technologies and value chains, while many in the Global South face fiscal constraints, debt and pressure to keep exporting fossil fuels or raw materials.

Climate finance makes this gap visible: adaptation is underfunded, loss-and-damage mechanisms remain modest, and access to concessional resources is complex for those who need it most. Geopolitical rivalries turn clean-energy industries into tools of influence rather than global public goods, slowing cooperation and creating new dependencies.

In Brazil and much of the Global South, communities that contribute least to emissions are the most exposed to floods, heatwaves and pollution, and have the least access to clean energy, resilient infrastructure and quality public services.

This is also a challenge significantly heightened by climate injustice where the communities of the Global South, which contribute the least to emissions, bear the heaviest impacts, while those with the greatest historical responsibility and resources to act often remain insulated from immediate consequences, reducing urgency for transformative action.
The result is fragmented climate action where individual awareness is not translated into collective pressure, nor do global commitments trickle down to local implementation. We need frameworks that make climate responsibility tangible and equitable by holding major emitters accountable while ensuring Global South communities aren't just recipients of climate aid but active participants in shaping solutions.

129,"From my experience in environmental engineering, wastewater management and environmental and social assessments, the biggest challenge for climate action today is the difficulty of transforming scientific knowledge into concrete, locally adapted solutions. Communities in the Global South understand climate risks, but often lack the technical support, financing and institutional coordination needed to implement resilient practices.

Another challenge is the fragmented governance of climate action. Adaptation involves multiple stakeholders�institutions, local authorities, communities�but they rarely operate with the same information or long-term vision. In my fieldwork, climate solutions fail not because they are technically complex, but because actors are not aligned in strategy or priorities.

Finally, young professionals and community voices remain underrepresented in climate decision-making, despite being closest to the impacts. Strengthening inclusive governance, improving access to climate knowledge and building practical capacity at the local level are, in my view, essential steps to accelerate meaningful and equitable climate action.",0.43732953,0.47998852,0.6136985,0.7350248203492155,#f3a134
505,"One of the biggest challenges for climate action moment is the persistent gap between global commitments and real perpetration. While governments and institutions routinely promote driven targets, the repetition of these promises into concrete, locally effective conduct remains slow and inconsistent. This gap is made wider by constrained access to climate finance, especially for developing countries and vulnerable communities that are formerly passing severe climate impacts but warrant the coffers to acclimatize. 

Another major challenge is the lack of collaboration across sectors. Climate pitfalls cut across husbandry, health, water, structure, and livelihoods, yet numerous programs and interventions still operate in silos. Without integrated,cross-sector planning, climate results fall flat to address the connected nature of the extremity. 

Public mindfulness and misinformation also pose significant impediments. Communities habitually warrant clear, wisdom- grounded guidance on climate pitfalls or adaption measures, which decreases their capacity to prepare, respond, and advocate for stronger programs. 

Socio- profitable imbalances encourage consolidate these challenges. Marginalized populations face the topmost climate pitfalls, but immediate survival needs frequently make long- term climate activity delicate to prioritize. icing that results are inclusive, just, and centered around unique realities is fundamental but still lacking.

While innovative policies and technologies exist, vulnerable communities�like those in Kitui, Kenya�struggle to access and apply these solutions due to limited resources, infrastructure, and awareness.

Equity and inclusive participation are also critical challenges. Climate initiatives often overlook the voices of women, youth, and marginalized groups, whose local knowledge and creativity are essential for effective, context-specific solutions. Without empowering these communities, even well-intentioned programs may fail to create lasting impact.

Behavioral and cultural shifts add another layer of complexity, as sustainable practices require education, awareness, and alignment with local values.

1180,"The most significant challenge is the critical misalignment between global climate finance flows and the urgent, localized adaptation needs of the most vulnerable communities. While vast sums are discussed globally, the financing that reaches the frontline, particularly for social sectors like education, is often insufficient, inaccessible, and siloed. There is a ""financing gap"" in both quantity and quality.

This is compounded by a lack of capacity at the national and local levels to navigate complex application processes for major funds like the GCF, leading to a bottleneck in accessing and effectively deploying resources. The result is that communities facing the most severe climate impacts lack the tailored, predictable funding needed to build long-term resilience.

Overcoming this requires not just more funding, but smarter systems. We must simplify access mechanisms, de-risk investments to attract private capital for adaptation, and, crucially, build the institutional capacity of local and national governments. Empowering them to design bankable projects and manage funds transparently is essential to ensure climate finance translates into tangible protection for vulnerable populations and critical systems like education and health.",0.78986526,0.5523425,0.8543916,0.6241528459178423,#f7e379

A second challenge lies in the fragmentation of climate initiatives. Numerous promising projects remain isolated or short-term, without integration into long-term public policy frameworks or sustainable funding models. This limits scalability and reduces the impact on vulnerable populations.

Youth inclusion is another critical issue. Despite being among the most affected by climate change, young people often have limited access to decision-making spaces and insufficient support to develop innovative climate solutions.

Overcoming these challenges requires a stronger focus on local capacity-building, improved access to climate finance, investment in digital and data-management systems, and more inclusive governance models.

As a result, climate action often remains aspirational rather than operational.

A second dimension of the challenge is the persistent inequality in climate responsibility and vulnerability. Countries that contribute the least to global emissions are often the most exposed to climate impacts, yet they have the least access to resources that would enable adaptation, resilience building, and sustainable development. This imbalance creates a cycle in which climate risks deepen existing inequalities, making long-term climate planning even more difficult.

In addition, there is a significant gap in public awareness and political prioritisation.

One of the biggest challenges for climate action today is the gap between awareness and implementation. While the world increasingly understands the urgency of climate change, translating this knowledge into coordinated, large-scale action remains difficult. This challenge is driven by several interconnected factors: inadequate financing, weak political will, limited community participation, and the slow adoption of climate-resilient technologies.
Many vulnerable countries face the greatest climate risks but lack the resources to invest in adaptation measures such as resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and sustainable water management. At the same time, global climate finance is often inaccessible, delayed, or insufficient to meet the scale of the problem.
Another major obstacle is the disconnect between climate policies and the realities of local communities. Climate solutions cannot succeed without grassroots involvement, yet many initiatives are designed without fully considering local knowledge, cultural contexts, or socio-economic barriers.

2048,"Major Climate Challenges in West Africa

West Africa faces severe and interconnected climate challenges that threaten its environment, economy, and food security. Rapid land degradation and desertification, driven by unsustainable farming, deforestation, and population growth, are reducing soil fertility and shrinking arable land. Water scarcity is increasing as rainfall becomes more unpredictable, affecting agriculture, livestock, and access to safe drinking water.

Coastal erosion and rising sea levels are endangering major cities, infrastructure, and livelihood systems, especially for communities depending on fisheries. At the same time, extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, undermining resilience and development gains.

The region also struggles with limited access to clean energy, leading to dependence on firewood and charcoal, which accelerates deforestation and increases carbon emissions. Waste management remains a critical issue, with large amounts of organic waste causing pollution instead of being transformed into valuable resources. Socio-economic vulnerability, population pressures, and limited climate finance further restrict adaptation capacity.

To secure a sustainable future, West Africa needs inclusive climate solutions that support resilient agriculture, restore ecosystems, expand renewable energy, and strengthen community-based adaptation.

Another challenge is unequal capacity. Climate-smart solutions exist, but they remain inaccessible to those who need them most due to limited skills, technology, and institutional support. This slows adoption and widens vulnerability.

Climate action is also too siloed. Environmental, agriculture, marine, and financial sectors often work separately, even though climate impacts cut across all of them. Without coordination, policies become fragmented and less effective.

Moreover, the transition to renewables, though accelerating, faces logistical and financial challenges. Many countries, particularly those reliant on fossil fuel exports like Nigeria, resist transitioning due to economic dependency. Renewable energy adoption to regions like Europe and US is constrained by high costs, slow policy reform and infrastructure limitations.

Ultimately, the climate crisis is not just a technological challenge but a political and equity-driven one, requiring global collaboration, financial commitments and bold leadership to overcome these barriers.",0.90577817,0.24481726,0.13545787,0.7895933310706285,#f3a134
512,"I believe the biggest challenge for climate action today is the gap between awareness and real action. Many people know climate change is a serious problem, but they do not feel the urgency to change their habits or support solutions. This gap slows down progress and makes it harder for communities to respond effectively.
Another major challenge is the amount of plastic waste and pollution, especially in places like our beaches and oceans. Even though many organizations work hard to clean up, plastics continue to pile up faster than we can remove them. Without stronger systems for recycling, reducing waste, and stopping pollution at the source, we will keep fighting the same problem again and again.
For young people, the challenge is even greater. They care about the environment, but often lack the resources, support, or platforms to lead projects. Many youth want to help but don�t know where to start or feel that their voices are not heard.
Climate action also struggles because communities are not always united. Some people think climate change is too big to solve, while others wait for governments or big companies to act first. This slows down the teamwork we need.
To overcome these challenges, we must empower youth, strengthen community action, create better waste management systems, and turn awareness into meaningful daily habits. When everyone understands that small actions matter and works together, real change becomes possible.

1477,"The biggest challenge in climate action is the disparity in responsibility and capacity. The gap between the poorest island nations (like Cabo Verde) and the richest countries creates a two-sided impasse:

Rich Countries (Largest Emitters): Their challenge is the lack of political will and slow pace in meeting commitments for drastic emissions reduction and climate finance. They resist prioritizing climate over immediate economic growth, despite their historical responsibility.

Poorest Island Nations (Most Vulnerable): Their challenge is double vulnerability. They face devastating impacts like sea-level rise (urgent need for Adaptation) but lack the financial and technical capacity to protect themselves and develop sustainably (need for Means of Implementation).

The central issue is the failure of rich nations to deliver the promised annual $100 billion in climate finance. Without this funding for Adaptation and Mitigation in poorer countries, global action remains paralyzed and unjust.

1310,"The Biggest Challenge for Climate Action (250 Words)
One of the biggest challenges facing climate action today is the gap between global commitments and actual implementation. While governments, international organizations, and private actors frequently announce ambitious targets for mitigation and adaptation, the pace of real action on the ground remains far too slow to match the urgency of the crisis. This implementation gap is driven by several interconnected barriers.
First, insufficient financing, especially for developing countries, limits the ability of vulnerable nations to adapt effectively. Although climate finance pledges exist, much of it arrives late, in small amounts, or in the form of loans that increase national debt. This prevents frontline communities from building resilience, investing in clean energy, and addressing climate-induced losses and damages.
Second, climate action is hindered by political and economic interests that prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability. Fossil fuel dependence, weak regulatory systems, and resistance from powerful industries slow down the transition to greener economies. ",0.9679105,0.26486266,0.58686686,0.8499918969449732,#f3a134
2703,"I think biggest challenge facing climate action today is the yawning chasm between the imperative for transformative change and the glacial pace of global cooperation and implementation. Despite the growing urgency of the climate crisis, the world remains woefully off track to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5�C target, with current policies projected to lead to a catastrophic 2.7�C of warming by 2100.

A significant obstacle to progress is the disproportionate influence of fossil fuel interests, which have consistently blocked or watered down climate measures at international negotiations, including COP30. The stranglehold of petrostates and fossil fuel lobbyists on the policymaking process has hindered efforts to phase out fossil fuels, despite the pressing need to transition to renewable energy sources.

Furthermore, the lack of climate finance and support for vulnerable countries is a severe indictment of the global community's lack of commitment to climate justice. Developing nations are crying out for investment to adapt to climate impacts, transition to clean energy, and build resilience, but wealthy countries have failed to deliver on their climate finance commitments, leaving a staggering funding gap.

Ultimately, the biggest challenge facing climate action is not just about addressing the symptoms of climate change, but about transforming the underlying systems and structures that drive it.",0.88168645,0.1960119,0.24551666,0.8382585341718284,#f3a134
2704,"One big challenge to effective climate action today is the persistent lack of awareness, especially at the community level. Long before international negotiations began, people like us in the Niger Delta were already experiencing the brunt of the climate crisis. We saw the floods become unpredictable and extreme, yet we could not understand what was happening or why. Every year, we live in fear that the next rainy season might bring another disaster, one strong enough to force us from our homes into uncomfortable displacement camps provided by the government.

Despite facing these realities firsthand, awareness of climate change in my community remains extremely low. Even among the small percentage of people who are educated, many still deny the existence or severity of the crisis. This creates a major barrier: how can we unite to confront a problem we have not fully acknowledged? This awareness gap has shaped much of my work, inspiring me to engage young people- our most powerful change agents as well as local leaders, so we can collectively take informed action against climate threats.

2706,"The biggest challenge for climate action today is the widening gap between global ambition and real, on-the-ground implementation. While commitments are becoming more ambitious, progress remains slow due to structural barriers such as insufficient climate finance, fragmented governance and short-term political cycles. This challenge is particularly acute in the Global South, where countries like Peru face climate vulnerabilities intensified by limited access to technology, investment and resilient infrastructure. At the same time, Latin America is rich in renewable energy potential, biodiversity and innovative community-led solutions�yet these strengths remain under-leveraged. Another major challenge is the lack of strong cross-regional cooperation, especially between Latin America and Europe, at a moment when shared learning on renewable energy, green industrialization and just transitions is crucial. Without coordinated, multilevel efforts that include governments, private sector, civil society and youth, climate action remains siloed and insufficient. Bridging the ambition�implementation gap requires long-term financing mechanisms, inclusive governance, and partnerships that elevate Global South perspectives and expertise. Real climate progress depends on transforming commitments into equitable, context-sensitive action.",0.8142016,0.34903085,0.79198015,0.8170958189212002,#f3a134
2707,"I think the biggest challenge of achieving results from climate action is in the difficulties of collaboration and cooperation across society. Geopolitical tides have always turned and the failure of climate agreements are always made public, for example, but my limited experience of the world suggests there are already many people working to tackle various climate issues at local and international levels.

However, the issue is not a lack of motivation or efficacy of people�s individual actions; it�s that addressing complex and multifaceted issues are necessarily dependent upon actions that build upon one another. Waste management and recycling, a personal and academic passion of mine could demonstrate this: last December the global plastics treaty failed to reach consensus, yet even at the local level in Hong Kong, policies have been unable (or has not yet found a better way) to coordinate the human workforce involved, manufacturers and importers of goods and the core human habits surrounding consumption. 

A single conference will not remedy this, but I believe it helps build the experience, connections and belief that change can happen even with the exchange and discussion of ideas; this is where further actions may later ripple and magnify, but only if there is somewhere for us to start doing so, no matter where this conversation is held.
